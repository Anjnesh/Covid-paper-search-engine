Patients that present with mild disease typically develop an efficient immune response.

The cytokine storm is characterized by the overproduction and release of over 150 inflammatory cytokines due to overactivation and hyperproliferation of T cells, macrophages, and NK cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that interleukin-6 (IL-6) may be a potential therapeutic target to mediate the cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19, as IL-6 serum levels correlate with disease mortality in patients with fatal COVID-19 cases (11, 12) . However, while IL-6 has previously been implicated as a notable marker of the cytokine storm, other recent studies have also described the cytokine storm to be associated with expression of an alarmin called calprotectin (S100A8/A9) (13, 14) .",

            "text": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Alarmins are endogenous, immune-activating proteins that are released to initiate and amplify inflammatory immune responses (15, 16) . In response to microbial infection, alarmins relay intercellular defense signals by interacting with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to activate immune responses, which involve the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes to eliminate foreign microorganisms, the activation of resident leukocytes, and the production of inflammatory mediators (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . However, uncontrolled production or sustained expression of alarmins can be harmful or even fatal to the host and can result in cytokine storm or excessive inflammation, as is observed in severe COVID-19 cases (8, (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . S100 proteins are recognized as a major category of alarmins, among defensins, interleukins, heat shock proteins, high-mobility group proteins, cathelin-related anti-microbial peptides, and eosinophil derived neurotoxins (16, 26) . S100A8 and S100A9, also known as myeloid-related protein 8 (MRP8) and MRP14, are members of the S100 protein family (1). Similar to other S100 proteins, both S100A8 and S100A9 have a helixloop motif containing charged amino-acid residues that result in high affinity for divalent ions, such as Ca 2+ and Zn 2+ (1). Together, S100A8 and S100A9 form the calcium-binding heterodimer known as calprotectin (S100A8/A9), which makes up approximately 45% of the cytoplasmic proteins present in human neutrophils (11) . While both S100A8 and S100A9 form non-covalent homodimers, at high calcium concentrations, the heterodimer formation is more stable and prominent as compared to either homodimer configuration (27) . It's small size (24 kDa) allows it to easily diffuse between the tissue and blood and its resistance to degradation emphasizes its usefulness as a sensitive and dynamic marker for neutrophil activation throughout the body (1,28,29). Upon binding divalent ions, S100A8/A9 undergoes a conformational change that allows it to exert many of its functions, such as regulating leukocyte migration and trafficking, amplifying inflammatory responses, and modulating cell chemotaxis (1,28,30). Intracellularly, high levels of S100A8/A9 are stored in neutrophils and myeloid-derived dendritic cells where it is involved in cytoskeleton rearrangement and arachidonic acid metabolism (1).",

S100A8/A9 secretion relies on an alternative energy-dependent pathway whereby activated monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils require an intact cytoskeleton, activation of protein kinase C (PKC), and microtubule formation for S100A8 and S100A9 secretion (27) .

However, tissue damage can sustain amplified S100A8/A9 production, which promotes autocrine production, resulting in a hyperinflammation loop that prevents the protein from exerting its protective function (29, (35) (36) (37) (38) . This sustained over-expression of S100A8/A9 can result in uncontrolled inflammation and cytokine storm, as has been observed in COVID-19 cases.",

The same trends are observed in non-humanprimate (NHP) studies as well, where SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques exhibited robust expression of S100A8 between 3-5 days post infection (dpi) (46) . In fact, S100A8 was the most significantly induced gene among all known alarmins and its upregulation corresponded with an increase in the viral lung burden (46) . Consistent with these findings, the lung samples from post-mortem COVID-19 patients also had elevated expression of S100a8 and neutrophil marker genes (46) . In COVID-19 positive patients, S100A8 expression was markedly higher compared to healthy subjects, supporting previous findings that indicate the potential of S100A8/A9 as a biomarker for COVID-19 disease severity and outcomes. Consistent with the results from the NHP experiment, SARS-CoV-2-infected human ACE2 transgenic mice exhibited robust anti-bacterial humoral response, neutrophil chemotaxis, and upregulated transcription of S100a8 and neutrophil marker genes (Ly6G, Mmp8 etc.) at 5 dpi, corresponding to when mice became sicker.",

However, it is possible that mature neutrophils harboring large amounts of S100A8/A9 migrate to the lungs where S100A8/A9 is released, which amplifies the aberrant innate anti-viral response in a positive feedback loop. The uncontrolled, excessive production of S100A8/A9 may strongly stimulate the TLR4 signal, which then results in the induction of an aberrant neutrophil subset and imbalance of immune response as observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection (46) . S100A8/A9 binds to TLR4 and RAGE to mediate pro-inflammatory responses and mice lacking MyD88, an essential adaptor protein which acts as a signal transducer in the IL-1 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and TLR signaling pathways, exhibit suppression of TLR4 signaling. However, when COVID-infected mice were treated with recombinant S100A8/A9, expression of S100a8 and neutrophil chemokine Cxcl2 are induced in a TLR-4/Myd88-dependent manner, which reflects the ability of S100A8/A9 to induce expression of itself.",

Mtb proliferates in the lungs and individuals with active TB (ATB) disease can transmit the bacteria to other individuals. Understanding what drives TB pathogenesis is crucial for decreasing mortality and transmission rates, especially in low-resource and high TB-incidence areas. Elevated serum S100A8/A9 levels have been implicated in enhanced TB disease, along with increased neutrophil accumulation (58) . Not only are S100A8/A9 levels correlated to neutrophil accumulation, but it has also been determined that the alarmin directly mediates neutrophil accumulation by regulating CD11b expression on myeloid cells (59) . Furthermore, when neutrophils from WT Mtb-infected mice were extracted and adoptively transferred to Mtb-infected mice that lacked a functional copy of S100A8/A9, CD11b expression increased significantly. These results suggest that S100A8/A9-deficiency is directly involved in regulating CD11b expression on neutrophils. In addition, S100A8/A9-deficiency depleted J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f neutrophil accumulation to the lung as well as in granulomas and was associated with decreased lung bacterial burden and increased host-control over Mtb infection.",

Identifying and utilizing a predictive biomarker than is indicative of disease severity can allow physicians to treat patients effectively for better prognosis. While recent studies have identified several biomarkers that are significantly associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients (such as lymphopenia, C-reactive protein (CRP), calcitonin (CT), D-dimer, creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, and creatinine and serum amyloid A) accumulating evidence suggests that S100A8/A9 may be a better biomarker than those previously identified (1,14,48,63-66). S100A8/A9 is more appealing as biomarker over commonly used inflammatory biomarkers, such as CRP and CT, which require de novo protein biosynthesis. However, S100A8/A9 is synthesized and secreted locally at the inflammatory site before being released into the bloodstream, giving it a decisive kinetic advantage as it J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f may be the first host response to inflammatory conditions (1,6). S100A8/A9 has a documented half life of 5 hours, and its stability at room temperature contributes to its potential as a clinical biomarker in inflammatory diseases, including COVID-19 (1, 48, 51) . The local production and secretion is beneficial, as S100A8/A9 can be detected in several bodily fluids (such as stool, serum, synovial, and salivary media) and has already been investigated as a potential biomarker for a number of inflammatory conditions, such as CF, IBS, and rheumatoid arthritis (1,30,67 ). Due to its elevated levels in other bodily samples and its use as a biomarker in other diseases, the specificity of S100A8/A9 must be determined to indicate if poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 can be accurately predicted in the presence of other inflammatory comorbidities. Plasma S100A8/A9 levels are significantly higher in control, mild, and severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities as compared to those without comorbidities (48) . However, the observed increase in S100A8/A9 in patients with severe COVID-19 far exceeded correlations associated with comorbidities, which included obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and cancer (48) . Furthermore, when S100A8/A9 plasma levels were modeled using multivariable linear regression to take into account potential confounding factors (such as age, sex, and comorbidities), the previously observed correlations with neutrophil count, fibrinogen, and D dimers, remained statistically significant (48) . Therefore, further studies are needed to determine potential confounding factors should S100A8/A9 be used as a clinical biomarker.",

While serum levels in healthy individuals are typically below 1 ug/mL, these levels are reported to rise by nearly 100-fold following inflammation (1,30) . Though multiple studies have found that serum samples from clinical COVID-19 patients contain elevated S100A8/A9 levels that correspond to disease severity, Bauer et al. investigated S100A8/A9 levels in regard to prediction of prognosis in COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) (6, 46, 48, 68) .

Administration of resatorvid, a selective TLR4 inhibitor that downregulates the expression of downstream TLR4 signaling molecules, to control mice and mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, resulted in a decrease to the aberrant neutrophil subset, the viral replication in the lungs, and both S100a8 and Ly6g expression (46) . However, S100A8/A9 is also known to interact with RAGE. To determine the importance of S100A8/A9-RAGE interactions in severe COVID-19 cases, mice were treated with azeliragon, a RAGE inhibitor. Azeliragon treatment did not significantly prevent the production of the aberrant neutrophil subset or viral replication, indicating that the TLR4 pathway may play a critical role in fatal COVID-19 cases (46) . Together, these results highlight the therapeutic target potential of S100A8/A9 in improving host control over the infection by suppressing the abnormal immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because S100A8, S100A9, and S100A8/A9 are implicated in several inflammatory conditions, a variety of S100-specific inhibitors have been developed for therapeutic treatment. Notably, quinoline-3-carboxamide derivatives, such as tasquinimod, have been shown to bind to S100A9 and the S100A8/A9 complex to block the interaction of S100A9 with TLR4 and RAGE (1,28). Aside from treating inflammatory infectious diseases, inhibiting S100A8/A9 has been shown to decrease lung inflammation during IAV infection, prevent liver injury and bacterial dissemination during human sepsis and endotoxemia, and improve the clinical score of rheumatoid arthritis patients by nearly 50% (41, 74) . Additionally, S100A8/A9 inhibition has been shown to alleviate worsening of disease in other inflammatory conditions, such as tuberculosis, where Mtb-infected B6 mice treated with FPS-ZM1, another RAGE inhibitor, decreased the bacterial lung burden to levels comparable to Mtb-infected S100A9-deficient mice (59) .",

            "text": "Although S100A8/A9 has been implicated in inflammatory conditions, such as IBS, CF, and rheumatoid arthritis, it acts distinctively during SARS-CoV-2 infection to drive the formation and chemotaxis of a group of aberrant neutrophils, which are thought to drive fatal coronavirus infections and cytokine storm. While its role in chemotaxis has previously been identified in TB disease pathogenesis, S100A8/A9 notably affects the formation of immature neutrophil subsets during SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly through its interactions with TLR4. Furthermore, while elevated serum and plasma levels of S100A8/A9 are indicative of worsening COVID-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 19 prognosis, it is possible that preventing S100A8/A9-TLR4 interactions through paquinimod or resatorvid treatment may improve disease outcome by limiting excessive S100a8 and Ly6g expression, thus reducing viral lung burden and diminishing the aberrant neutrophil population as has been observed in mice. However, additional studies are needed to confirm the changes in disease phenotype in other animal models following treatment of paquinimod or resatorvid. Future research should be aimed at distinguishing the function and mechanism of induction of the aberrant neutrophil subset, as it will provide valuable information on potential contributions to deteriorating COVID-19 cases and how to prevent the subset from worsening disease outcomes. where patients with severe COVID-19 had increased circulating levels of S100A8/A9 that drives emergency myelopoiesis and the formation of an aberrant immature neutrophil subset. E) Treatment with S100A9 inhibitors blocks S100A8/A9-mediated TLR4 signaling and decreases viral replication, S100a8 expression, and diminish the number of aberrant CD45 + CD11b + Ly6G variable neutrophils in mice.
