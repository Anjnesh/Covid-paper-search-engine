The causative agent was the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was identified and isolated from a single patient in early January 2020 and subsequently verified in sixteen additional patients. The virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin. In particular, the Huanan Seafood Market, a live animal and seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, was regarded as a primary source of this epidemic, as it is found that 55% of the first four hundred twenty-five confirmed cases were linked to the marketplace. Meanwhile, recent comparisons of the genetic sequences of this virus and bat coro-naviruses show a 96% similarity (Lu et al. 2020) .",

The authors of (Peng et al. 2020) validate their model by analyzing data correlation on public data of the National Health Commission of China from January 20 to February 9, 2020, and produce reliable estimates and predictions, revealing key parameters of the COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we modify the model analyzed in (Peng et al. 2020) in order to consider optimal control problems. More precisely, we introduce three control variables and combine them with the main parameters of the model of (Peng et al. 2020 ). Secondly, we analyze a concrete optimal control problem, solving it analytically through the celebrated Pontryagin minimum principle (Pontryagin et al. 1962) . Moreover, we perform numerical simulations of the spread of COVID-19 in Italy from September 1 to November 30, 2020. The model of (Peng et al. 2020 ) has shown to be a good model to describe the reality of China. It's weakness is that it just tries to describe a reality but without controlling it. Our main purpose and contribution here is to include control measures that allow us to interfere with reality. Moreover, we want to illus-trate the validity of the model in a different context. For this reason, we have considered real data of COVID-19 from Italy instead of China.",

Our results show that the generalized SEIR model of (Peng et al. 2020) , originally considered for China, is also effective with respect to Italy, being able to model well available real data, while our optimal control approach shows clearly the positive and crucial effects of social distancing, preventive means, and treatment in the combat of COVID-19.

            "text": "Recent results have shown how the theory of optimal control is an important tool to combat COVID-19 in a community: in ) for a controlled sanitary deconfinement in Portugal; in (Zamir et al. 2021 ) from a more theoretical point of view; here for the case of Italy. We proposed a simple SEIR-type control system, showing its effectiveness with respect to real data from Italy in the period from September 1 to November 30, 2020. While the real data (see Appendices A, B and C) is consistent with the generalized SEIR model (1), because the goal of this model is to describe well the COVID-19 reality, our new SEIR control system (5) simulates what would happen if we took into account the values of the three control functions, as described in Section 3. In agreement, the situations obtained with controls are better than the situations obtained without controls. More precisely, by considering the proposed controls, we show how optimal control theory could have drastically diminish the burden of COVID-19 in the period under study while taking into account the resulting cost reduction. In concrete, if it would have been possible to implement optimally, in the sense of optimal control theory and Pontryagin's optimality conditions, the control measures of social distancing as in Figure 5a , preventive means as in Figure 5b , and treatment as in Figure 5c , then it would have Number of the exposed cases been possible to decrease significantly the number of deaths (cf. Figure 4 and Tables 3 and 4, which account a decrease of 7.36% of deaths in Italy by the of October 2020 under optimal control) with much less quarantined individuals (see Figure 3e and Tables 5 and 6 , which account a decrease of 99.96% of quarantined individuals in Italy by the end of October 2020 under optimal control theory). Thus, one can say that the approach proposed by the theory of optimal control is very effective, simultaneously from health and economical points of view, being far from trivial. Note that by following Pontryagin's minimum priciple one obtains an increase on the number of recovered individuals in a first period, up to 14-Oct-2020, and, after this date, a decrease on the number of recovered (cf. Figure 3f and Tables 1 and 2), caused by the drastic reduction on the number of susceptible and infected (see Figures 3b and 3c , respectively). While our aim here was to study the effect of controls, guided by application of the Pontryagin minimum principle and showing how they can help to decrease the spread of COVID-19, other aspects remain open for further research. In particular, it remains open the theoretical study of the stability of the models. In this direction, the recent results of (Boukhouima et al. 2021, Nda\u00efrou and Torres 2021) may be useful. ",
