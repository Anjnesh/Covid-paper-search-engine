Descriptive statistics, the chi-square test, the Pearson's correlation coefficient, and stepwise multiple linear regression were used for data analysis. Results: Most of the participants had a cardiovascular disease (34.0%). Followed by diabetes (28.8%), cancer (11.2%), hypertension (10.0%), heart disease (9.6%), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (6.4%) and had a moderate level of overall HPBs (M = 106.09; SD = 4.66). Among the six components of the HPBs, the participants achieved the moderate levels in nutrition, interpersonal relations, spiritual growth, and stress management, and low levels in physical-activity and health responsibility. The patients' perception of the benefits and barriers to the adoption of HPBs and perceived self-efficacy and social support were able to predict their HPBs, accounting for approximately 38.0% of the variance of such behaviors. Conclusion: On the basis of our study's results, we suggest that researchers, multidisciplinary teams, the government, and policymakers establish effective interventions, guidelines, and policies for the development of HPBs to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 particularly among patients with NCDs, and to improve their capacity for high-quality and continuing self-care.",

            "text": "The world is currently facing a great health crisis due to the second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 . 1, 2 Due to the virulence and mutations of the virus causing such disease (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the number of human infections is continuing to increase, and the pathogenesis is more severe worldwide than in the first wave. 3 Worldometers 4 reported that as of July 11, 2021 , there have been 187,632,756 cases of COVID-19 infection and 4,049,071 COVID-19 deaths. The World Health Organization also reports the new cases of infection and deaths around the world, and the data show that COVID-19 affects all age groups and especially people who have high health risks or a weak immune system. 2 Most of the patients often develop severe symptoms leading to death, including pregnant women, children aged 6 months to 2 years, older adults, disabled people, and thalassemia or immunocompromised patients. 5, 6 In addition, obese people with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m 2 and people with chronic diseases, particularly non-communicable diseases (NCDs), are also especially vulnerable to the disease. [7] [8] [9] NCDs are the most important public health problems and the leading cause of death, rehospitalization, and care expenditure. 10, 11 The number of deaths from NCDs worldwide increased from 38 million in 2012 to 41 million in 2016 (71% of the total deaths worldwide), with cardiovascular disease (17.9 million, 44%), cancer (9.0 million, 22%), chronic respiratory diseases (3.8 million, 9%), and diabetes (1.6 million, 4%) causing the most deaths. 12 Annually, 15 million people with NCDs within the age range 30-69 years around the world prematurely die, with the high death rates in such population in different countries severely affecting such countries' socioeconomic development. 11 In Thailand, NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, cancers, and chronic respiratory diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, 13 and the continuing rise in the number of people with NCDs, particularly older adults, is concerning. 14 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on NCDs is multifaceted. Several countries, including Thailand, have implemented restrictive measures during the pandemic, such as lockdowns, social distancing, and travel restrictions, to decrease the spread of COVID-19, and this has adversely affected particularly the people with NCDs by limiting their ability to secure healthy foods and supplements, to engage in outdoor physical activities, and to obtain medical care or access health services. 1, 11 Evidence obtained since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that quarantine and physical distancing can lead to poor self-management of patients with NCDs and to health risk factors such as lack of physical activity, food insecurity or unhealthy consumption, harmful use of alcohol, and tobacco use. 15 In addition, without adequate and proper management of NCDs, the chronic conditions can worsen due to the stress resulting from restrictions, insecure economic situation, and changes in the new normal of health-related behaviors during the pandemic. 16 NCDs can be prevented and controlled if the patients carry out regular and ongoing self-care. When patients with NCDs have appropriate self-care and healthpromoting behaviors, they can help reduce the severity of the disease and improve their quality of life. Although several researchers have assessed health-promoting behaviors, most of the previous studies focused only on the health-promoting behaviors (HPBs) of patients with NCDs living in communities. 13, 14, 17 Hospitalized patients with NCDs during the second wave of COVID-19 face great challenges because before their hospital discharge, they need to prepare to take care of themselves at home, without support from multidisciplinary healthcare teams.",

            "text": "With regard to the relationships among the participants' characteristics, perceived self-efficacy, social support, perceived benefits of and barriers to the adoption of healthpromoting behaviors, and HPBs and the factors that could predict HPBs among hospitalized patients with NCDs during the second wave of COVID-19, we found that the four independent variables in this study could predict the HPBs of patients with NCDs, accounting for approximately 38.0% of the variance of such behaviors. It was found in this study that the best predictor of the HPBs of patients with NCDs is social support. According to House et al, 24 social support can help patients express their distress and frustration and feel valued and important, and inevitably affects their ability to take care of themselves and have better health-promoting behaviors. The findings of this study are consistent with that of Yoowattana et al, 25 and of Suksatan and Ounprasertsuk, 13 that social support influenced the self-care behavior of the chronically ill elderly people in the central region of Thailand (\u03b2 = 0.376, p < 0.001 and \u03b2 = 0.408, p < 0.001, respectively). Similar to our results, the perception of social support by elderly patients living in a community correlate with and influence their self-care (\u03b2 = 0.45; p < 0.014). 26 On the basis of our study's results, we suggest that social support from healthcare providers and families is essential for patients with NCDs during the current COVID-19 pandemic as it may be an important contributor to behavior change in such patients, who have become inactive due to the challenges they have been facing in terms of motivation to adopt health-promoting behaviors. Second, perception of the barriers to the adoption of HPBs was found to be another significant predictor of HPBs among hospitalized patients with NCDs during the second wave of COVID-19. This can be explained by the fact that the deteriorating physical conditions of patients with a chronic illness may hinder such patients' performance of different activities. In addition, due to the economic crisis during the pandemic, many people with chronic NCDs have lower incomes because they work less but still have to obtain treatment for their disease and stay in the hospital more often, which constitutes an obstacle to their adoption of health-promoting behaviors. A previous study demonstrated that the barriers to the adoption of HPBs perceived by older adults with hypertension in Indonesia influenced their HPBs (\u03b2 = \u22120.129; p = 0.001). 27 Similarly, Rasamejam et al, 28 found that the barriers to the adoption of HPBs perceived by Thai Muslims with hypertension influenced their HPBs (\u03b2 = \u22121.61; p < 0.001). Bunthan et al, 17 also found that perceived barriers to the adoption of HPBs prevented older adults in Thailand to adopt HPBs to protect themselves from COVID-19 infection (\u03b2 = \u2212189; p = 0.002). Conversely, a previous study showed that perceived barriers to the adoption of HPBs did not significantly predict the preventive health behavior of wearing a facemask among Chinese adults to protect themselves from acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome. However, the perceived barriers to the adoption of HPBs are important and have always played a significant role in determining patients' health-related behaviors.",

This result of our study is consistent with that of another study 27 that perceived self-efficacy influenced the HPBs of older Indonesian adults with hypertension (\u03b2 = 0.321; p < 0.000), and with the result of the study by Bunthan et al, 17 that perceived self-efficacy influenced the HPBs of older adults for the prevention of COVID-19 infection (\u03b2 = 0.313; p = 0.000).

This can be explained by health promotion model: when a person perceives the benefits of adopting health-promoting activities or anticipates the benefits that other people will receive from his or her adoption of such, it will motivate him or her to perform such behaviors. 29 The benefits that hospitalized patients with NCDs can be obtain from adopting HPBs are greater knowledge and understanding of the nature of one's disease, self-care, and health prevention during hospital stay. Patients who are getting better can be discharged from the hospital and go home and take care of themselves without the support received from healthcare providers during hospitalization. This result of the current study is consistent with that of Lim et al, 31 regarding the perceived benefits of adopting HPBs of the early elderly in South Korea living in rural and urban communities (\u03b2 = 0.738; p = 0.000 and \u03b2 = 0.336, p = 0.000, respectively). Suksatan 22 also found that the perceived benefits of adopting HPBs influenced the HPBs of people at risk of hypertension in a rural Thai community (\u03b2 = 0.402; p < 0.001). Additionally, perceived self-efficacy is a significant factor influencing HPBs and can predict the health outcomes of hospitalization and the quality of life of patients with NCDs (eg, diabetes, 32 hypertension, 33 heart failure, 34 and COPD 35 ).",

Second, as regards the nature of the sample, which was obtained using the convenient sampling method, the non-use of random sampling might have given rise to sample selection bias and may limit the findings' generalization. Third, our study did not explore the health-promoting behavior of hospitalized patients and different types of NCDs. Future studies should compare the different types of patients with NCDs or should focus on specific group of patients such as heart failure or cancer patients. Fourth, our study did not explore patient's laboratory testing. Future studies should therefore include patient's laboratory testing during hospitalization with specific group of patients on the basis of their medical records such as blood pressure and blood sugar levels. Finally, as our study had a cross-sectional design, it was not possible to identify the temporal relationships between the independent variables and health-promoting behaviors, and to determine cause-effect relationships. Interventional or longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify patients' long-term outcomes. The future research should involve patients with communicable diseases and other settings (eg, nursing homes and communities) to identify how the HPBs of and perspectives in these populations change as the COVID-19 pandemic shifts in scope.",
