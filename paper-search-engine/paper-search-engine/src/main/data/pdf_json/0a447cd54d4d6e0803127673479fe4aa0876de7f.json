However, when adjusted for age and the presence of comorbidities, 13 including CKD, HbA1c >9% (75 mmol/mol) was still associated with a lower risk of AKI 14 (appendix). These results are in contrast to the results of a study by Khalili et al. 29 , who 15 reported HbA1c to be a risk factor for development of AKI in patients hospitalized with 16 COVID-19. Further analysis of our data revealed that CKD was a much stronger risk factor 17 for AKI than HbA1c, and when analyzing patients in quartile 4, CKD was associated with 18 AKI while HbA1c was not (appendix). While our data indicate that HbA1c is negatively 19 associated with AKI, it is likely that our observed rates of AKI in quartile 4 are influenced 20 more by the lower rate of CKD in this group.",
