This study sought to identify and document common practices implemented by CRUs around the United States of America (USA) when addressing the unique challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This descriptive study utilized a non-experimental mixed-methods approach and gathered data from representatives of 43 CRUs across the USA. An online survey was followed by in-depth interviews. The findings show that challenges faced from the COVID-19 pandemic, changes made to daily operations, and lessons learned are very similar across CRUs. Although most CRUs never stopped performing essential clinical research, many adapted to the pandemic by engaging in virtual visits, and many played key roles in administering and supporting both COVID-19 therapeutic and vaccine trials. Follow-up interviews showed that processes for formal approval and reopening were similar across CRUs. In addition to highlighting the significance of the role played by CRUs during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study addresses the relevance of CRUs and lays the groundwork for future conversations on the importance of these units.",

Regardless of who ultimately approved the restart, PIs had to provide plans explaining how they would conduct their study safely given the pandemic restrictions.

Critical Research Units interviewed indicated that they have been following similar guiding principles and practices for study visits that were to be conducted in person. For example, study teams were to contact participants within 24 hours prior to a visit to confirm that the participant did not have any COVID-19 symptoms and to explain the screening procedures during their visit. The willingness of individuals to participate in various clinical research studies attests to their trust in safety campaigns and safety procedures at medical and research institutes. In many cases, clinical research teams also have known the participants for several years and have gained their understanding and respect. Participants were more than willing to cooperate. Similar sentiments were described in a study published by Padala et al.

In addition, CRUs were involved in testing the effectiveness of drugs such as Remdesivir and Losartan in preventing the progression of symptoms in participants who were SARS-CoV-2 positive.
