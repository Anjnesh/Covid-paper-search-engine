Overall, 93% of participants (14/15) were satisfied with the EQQUAL program, 100% (15/15) found it easy to use, and 100% (15/15) said it helped them be clearer about how to quit.

The rate of abstinence, which was biochemically confirmed, was 3 times higher than that of the only other digital program to date that has targeted sexual and gender minority young adults and 6 to 13 times higher than those of nontargeted digital smoking interventions among sexual and gender minority young adults. Planned improvements for the next iteration of the program include making the avatar's movements more natural; offering multiple avatar guides with different on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, and gender identity from which to choose; and providing a support forum for users to connect anonymously with peers.",

Compounding their risk for tobacco-related diseases, sexual and gender minority young adults also encounter unique barriers to accessing treatment. Almost half of sexual and gender minority young adults lack health insurance to pay for traditional treatments such as counseling and pharmacotherapy [2] , and there is substantial underuse of existing public health interventions such as tobacco quitlines among this group [3] . There is tremendous unrealized opportunity to reach these young tobacco users via digital means, because they are high adopters of technology [4] and would benefit from the availability of a high-reach, no-cost intervention due to the multiple barriers they face in accessing traditional forms of treatment. However, only one study [5] , published recently, tested a targeted digital intervention-a professionally moderated intervention delivered via Facebook-that was specifically for sexual and gender minority young adults. Although the study showed low biochemically confirmed quit rates overall, it demonstrated the potential efficacy of sexual and gender minority-targeted content, with quit rates for the targeted social media intervention (7%) almost double that of the nontargeted social media intervention (4%) [5] .",

Acceptability, as well as intervention impact on change processes and outcomes (ie, efficacy), are standard benchmarks in intervention development [6] . Together, they help provide proof-of-concept evidence that users will engage with the intervention and that it can impact theory-based change mechanisms and, ultimately, the outcome of interest. The purpose of this study was to evaluate components of the novel program requiring further refinement and to plan a future randomized clinical trial as a next step in treatment development and evaluation.",

In addition to focusing on increasing acceptance of smoking triggers and facilitating values-guided action as cessation treatment mechanisms, ACT also teaches generalizable emotion regulation skills that can increase resilience and buffer minority stress [8] among sexual and gender minority young adults. This generalizability stems from a transdiagnostic focus on building psychological flexibility-defined as willingness to experience the full range of emotional, physical, and cognitive experiences without trying to change them and to do things that are difficult in service of one's values [9, 10] . EQQUAL also employs another exciting innovation in digital tobacco treatment: an avatar guide designed to make the program more engaging and effective. The original avatar-led Flexiquit program (not sexual and gender minority-targeted) showed great promise in motivating cessation in a pilot randomized controlled trial with young adults in Cyprus, with a 29% posttreatment quit rate for Flexiquit versus 11% for the waitlist [7] . Importantly, the majority (65%) of participants were in the precontemplation or contemplation stages of change, demonstrating the program's utility for smokers who are at lower levels of quit readiness [7] .",

After translation, which occurred from August to September 2018, we followed a user-centered design process to adapt the program for the US culture and to a sexual and gender minority young adult population. This included 2 rounds of preliminary user testing (n=7 participants; 2 self-identified as female, 4 self-identified as male, and 1 did not self-identify as male, female, or transgender; 3 self-identified as bisexual and 4 self-identified as gay or lesbian; 2 self-identified as non-Hispanic White, 1 self-identified as non-Hispanic Asian, 1 as self-identified as non-Hispanic Asian and White, and 3 did not provide their race and ethnicity) and a diary study in which participants used the program for 1 week and provided feedback about it via daily diary entries and a final interview (n=8; 2 self-identified as female, 1 self-identified as male; 5 self-identified as transgender or nonbinary; 1 self-identified as bisexual, 2 self-identified as gay, 2 self-identified as queer, and 2-who self-identified as gender minority-did not provide their sexual orientation; 3 self-identified as non-Hispanic White, 2 self-identified as non-Hispanic Asian, and 3 did not provide their race and ethnicity).",

The most recent version of the avatar used in the original, nontargeted Flexiquit program was presented as a young woman ( Figure 1 ). As part of the testing, we evaluated users' reactions to this avatar as well as to several other potential program guides, including both human and nonhuman representations. Users unanimously preferred a human guide, with desired qualities being inspiring, fun, and sensitive. Users also indicated that they preferred having a visual representation of the program guide, rather than just a voice, as something concrete that they could count on consistently while they completed the program. Visually, users preferred cartoon-like over realistic-looking avatars. They also preferred avatars that appeared to be androgynous or gender ambiguous. Among the possible human representations presented to users, the previous Flexiquit avatar was not preferred. Users agreed that the avatar should have a backstory and share it and that the tone of the avatar should be conversational and informal. Participants wanted to be able to hear and read the content simultaneously. Several options for voices of the avatar were presented, and a preferred voice was selected on the basis of user testing, which was the voice of a young adult woman. Participants also expressed a desire for an avatar that could be customized or selected based on their ability to identify with it or be inspired by it. With the exception of the customizable avatar, which was cost-prohibitive for this phase of development, all of these user preferences were incorporated into the design of the EQQUAL program.",

Self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) from smoking was assessed via the question: \"When was the last time you smoked, or even tried, a cigarette?\" Responses of \"8-30 days ago\" and \"over 30 days ago\" were classified as 7-day PPA.

A sample size of 25 was chosen on the basis of this recommendation. Because this is a single-arm pilot trial, this study is not designed for power to detect statistically significant changes in response to treatment. However, we planned to preliminarily and descriptively assess the outcomes of the intervention to inform further refinements of EQQUAL and obtain the information necessary to optimize the study design in preparation for a subsequent Stage 2 efficacy trial.",

The product of our user-centered design work, the EQQUAL program, demonstrated strong acceptability and efficacy in a single-arm pilot trial with 22 sexual and gender minority young adults. For example, 93% of participants (14/15) were satisfied with the EQQUAL program, 100% (15/15) found it easy to use, and 100% (15/15) said it helped them be clearer about how to quit. Both quantitative and qualitative results suggested a positive overall response to the avatar, with areas for future improvement largely centered on the avatar's appearance and movements. Regarding treatment utilization, including only those who logged in at least once (n=18), participants logged in an average of 6 times and completed an average of 3 sessions, with 39% completing all 6 sessions. This suggests that there is room for improvement in keeping users engaged with the program as a means of enhancing outcomes [24] . Indeed, our post hoc analysis suggested that there may be a relationship between engagement and outcomes given that 80% (4/5) of the participants who quit smoking completed all 6 sessions compared with only 18% (3/17) of the participants who did not quit. In addition to avatar improvements (eg, making the avatar's body movements more natural) and customization options (eg, offering choice of avatars with varying gender expression, race, ethnicity, etc), in future iterations of the program, we also plan to implement a social feature that was suggested by users in the initial user-centered design work but was out of scope for the present work. Social connectedness has been demonstrated to increase engagement in other digital programs [25] and was associated with better engagement and abstinence outcomes in an online tobacco treatment program [26, 27] . In addition, to prompt continued program use, we plan to include multiple session availability reminders rather than relying on a single reminder when a new session becomes available.",

Primary limitations stem from the small sample size and that causality cannot be determined from a single-arm pilot trial; therefore, conclusions about EQQUAL's efficacy or impact on theory-based change mechanisms are tentative and require evaluation in a larger, controlled clinical trial. Due to the small sample size, representativeness and generalizability are limited. For example, although 25% of the sample identified as a racial or ethnic minority, not every race and ethnicity could be represented. Another limitation concerning the generalizability of findings is that the data were collected during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have impacted participants' perceptions of the EQQUAL program and their willingness and ability to quit smoking. Based on the COVID-19-related questions that we included in the baseline and follow-up surveys, there were mixed findings regarding the pandemic's impact on smoking and motivation to reduce or quit, with some participants reporting little or no impact, some increasing their smoking, and some decreasing their smoking or experiencing increased motivation to reduce or quit smoking. Overall, the reported intensity of smoking at baseline (ie, averaging 7.6 cigarettes per day) is not atypical, as a majority of young adults smoke less than one-half pack (ie, less than 10 cigarettes) per day [29] . Another limitation is that it was not feasible in this pilot trial to conduct the testing that would allow us to biochemically verify smoking abstinence among participants who used other nicotine and tobacco products (eg, e-cigarettes). In future work, we plan to use a multimethod approach combining remote carbon monoxide monitoring with cotinine testing to address this limitation.",

(4) The self-guided, digital format makes EQQUAL readily accessible to sexual and gender minority young adults who lack health insurance and who have low engagement and quit rates with currently available public health interventions for cessation.
