Patients and Methods: Cross-sectional study of 215 patients attending a single tertiary center to assess their interest in teleophthalmology. Comparisons between those interested and those not interested were conducted; logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of price on interest. Results: Two thirds (66.5%) of patients were interested in teleophthalmology instead of inperson clinic visits. Those interested were significantly younger than uninterested patients (48.8\u00b122.7 vs 62.4\u00b118.3 years) and were more likely to miss work to attend clinic, own both a computer and smartphone, have experience with video conferencing, and use the internet frequently (all P<0.05). Interested patients were also more likely to indicate time and cost savings, as well as improved follow-up testing, compared to uninterested patients (both P<0.001). Overall, 70.4% of interested patients expressed WTP out-of-pocket for teleservices, especially at low (<$14 US dollars) and moderate-high (>$28) price points. Higher level of education was associated with WTP (OR=2.31, 95% CI 1.05-5.06; P=0.037). Conclusion: Most patients were interested in teleophthalmology services, especially if they were young, would otherwise miss work, and were familiar with electronics, video conferencing, and internet use. Most interested patients expressed WTP out-of-pocket. Targeting factors related to teleophthalmology interest may increase patient use and enhance communication, thereby improving healthcare access and follow-up.",

Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing requirements may make patients and providers hesitant to undergo and perform medical examinations in clinic rooms with limited space. Previous studies have demonstrated that patients who live further from urban medical centers are less likely to receive eye examinations, 3 and in diseases such as glaucoma, more than 30% of patients do not return for recommended follow-up tests, [4] [5] [6] preventing optimal management.

[7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Multiple studies have described the benefits of telemedicine in ophthalmology (teleophthalmology). [12] [13] [14] Advancements in digital fundus photography 10 and intraocular pressure measurement without the need for anesthetic eyedrops, 15 coupled with the ubiquity of mobile devices, hold significant potential to improve delivery of primary and specialized ophthalmic care, which in certain cases reduces the need for in-person visits to medical facilities. 2, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] The constantly increasing capabilities of internetconnected devices have made telemedicine increasingly feasible to implement in routine healthcare. Israel ranks second in the world in smartphone ownership, with 88% of the public owning smartphones. 22 This widespread mobile device ownership presents a unique opportunity: by implementing a telemedicine system that focuses on patient-owned devices as opposed to specialized devices (ie ones provided by the healthcare network), the cost of implementing a telemedicine system may be greatly reduced.

Optimizing these aspects when administering a teleophthalmology program and targeting reservations in certain populations with educational resources would be integral to fluid implementation of telehealth services. 25 Regardless of the potential for long-term cost-savings, startup expenses for teleophthalmology will likely be an obstacle to widespread implementation in healthcare systems, 26 though patients' willingness to pay out-ofpocket for such appointments might help to balance such expenses. For these reasons, we queried patients' willingness to pay out-of-pocket for telemedicine, finding reassuringly that the large majority of patents interested in teleophthalmology were willing to pay out-of-pocket. Interestingly, compared to those not willing to pay, we observed a greater interest in telemedicine among those willing to pay <$14 and >$28 USD, possibly suggesting that those with fewer or greater financial means value teleservices more than those willing to pay the moderate amount ($14 to 28 USD). Of note, a full face-to-face visit to a hospital clinic costs approximately 80 USD, and the amounts mentioned in the survey for willingness to pay out of pocket were generally lower. Further research is necessary to tease out these pricing intricacies and optimal payment structures, eg sliding scale, fee-for-service, subscription-or insurance-based.",

However, older patients were less likely to express interest, even though they may have the most to gain from teleservices due to comorbid medical conditions limiting their ability to attend in-person clinic and exacerbating their ocular conditions, and are more likely to experience disabling ocular morbidity. Educational interventions may be necessary to increase adoption in older patients, especially in a future where telemedicine is increasingly pervasive due to pandemics like COVID-19 limiting in-person visits. For instance, interested patients indicated that they perceived a benefit in the form of increased follow-up testing following teleophthalmology visits; this benefit might be emphasized for reluctant patients. Further, our finding that those with additional education beyond secondary school are more willing to pay out-of-pocket for teleophthalmology suggests that a lack of knowledge may be a barrier to receiving telemedicine. An educational program clearly elucidating the benefits of virtual services, especially targeted towards older patients, might enhance interest in this demographic. Specific resources for older patients, including videoconferencing education, tips for optimizing communication when wearing masks, and investment into hospital-provided, userfriendly devices, may improve usage in this population as well.",

Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic showed that disparities in healthcare access were actually amplified in some cases, rather than reduced. This is because only those of high enough socio-economic status had robust broadband technology at home and sufficient technical savvy, which could adequately participate in these types of video visits; this has been termed the \"digital divide\".
