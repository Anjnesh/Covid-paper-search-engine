This particular virus is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the size (26-32 kb) and it is from the family of the Coronaviridae in the Nidovirales of the genus named Betacoronavirus [1] A novel type strain of coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent for severe respiratory disease among human beings and the disease caused by it is named as Covid 19. The virus is easily transmittable from one human and eventually caused pandemic throughout the globe. The novel strain showed 80% homology with the type strain SARS-CoV which was responsible for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that demonstrated high rate of mortality in the year, 2002-2003. As per statistical report of Centre for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at John Hopkins University, nearly 1,400,000 cases of disease Coronavirus 19 have been reported till April 7th, 2020 [3] .",

The infection at lower respiratory tract causes symptoms such as fever, dry cough, dyspnea along with headache, dizziness, generalized weakness, vomiting and diarrhoea. Coronavirus is largely divided into following genera \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 depending on their structural E-mail addresses: maram.369@hotmail.com, maram.a@tu.edu.sa. genome. The particular strains 229 E and NL63 belong to \u03b1 group and causes common cold infections among humans. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to \u03b2 virus. Corona virus is composed of 4 structural proteins: Spike (S), membrane (M), envelop (E) and nucleocapsid (N). The spike proteins of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV attach to the Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 receptors are also expressed upon cells of organs lung, heart, ileum, kidney and bladder. This receptor is maximally expressed upon the lung epithelial cells through the virus enters and damages the cells. Epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) comprise the innate immunity in airway and T cell mediated response are also previously reported against coronavirus. Virus infected cells are phagocytosed by DCs which causes activation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. CD4 + T cells stimulate B cells to release virus specific antibody whereas CD8 + T cells kills virus infected cells. Severely infected patients were observed to demonstrate enhanced concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines within plasma, that includes interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)1 \u03b1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 [4] .",

            "text": "As per the observations of study by (Pal. Berhanu, Desalegn and Kandi, 2020) [5] , specific therapeutic procedure development against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SAR-S-COV-2) is premised upon the measure of exigency which currently exists throughout the world in the form of the pandemic brought about by this particular viral pathogen. Multiple drugs, including the anti-malarial and anti-Ebola virus drugs have been brought under investigation to be applied against the pathological complications initiated by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this context, according to Rabaan et al. (2020) [6] , the most significant contribution of entry of SARS-COV-2 into the cell cytoplasm of any individual, could be attributed to the enzyme Transmembrane pro-tease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, it has been argued by Mykytyn et al. (2021) [7] , that inhibition of activity of TMPRSS2 is fundamental towards prohibition of the entry of SARS-COV-2 within bronchial cell cytoplasm. Thus, according to Mykytyn et al. (2021) [7] , since the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been conducted the intensive screening of 1017 different, existing drugs. Out of such evaluated drugs, the Nafamostat Mesylate, a serine protease inhibitor which is clinically available, has been identified as the primary and most potent inhibitor for epithelial cell entry of Coronavirus which had been observed during the Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemic. To this effect, the research of (Yamamoto et al. 2016 ) have also highlighted that Nafamostat Mesylate has been proven to inhibit the SARS-COV-2 entry into human epithelial cells when EC 50 of ~10 nM had been the clinical evaluation threshold [8] . Previously, Nafamostat Mesylate had been utilised for treatment of patients suffering from acute pancreatitis and in cases of intravascular coagulation where Nafamostat Mesylate had successfully disseminated such clots. Furthermore, at clinical level trials, as per the research of Ng et al. (2020) , Nafamostat Mesylate, through intravenous administration within the blood circulation system, could sufficiently inhibit the viral entry of SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) into human epithelial cell cytoplasm, however, the concentration of the drug within the blood of the patient would be required to be sustained at 30-240 nM [4] .",

The outcomes specified that patients administered with the Favipriavir drug demonstrated greater recovery rate [11] . Furthermore, the chest radiography of involved groups of patients demonstrated greater recovery transformations in case of patients administered with the Favipriavir in comparison to that of patients administered with LPV/RTV [11] . Furthermore, (Atzrodt et al. 2020) have emphasised on secondary studies conducted within the same hospital, involving clinical trial with patients infected by SARS-COV-2 virus and the clinical trial outcomes demonstrated comparatively greater antiviral response when such patients had been administered with Favipriavir [10] . However, particular side effects such as Nausea had been registered within patients who had been administered Favipriavir, thus, Ohe, Furuya and Goudarzi (2021) have argued in favour of the proposition that, in case of patients with previous history of immunological and respiratory complications, Favipriavir could be administered only in particular percentage-based combination with drugs which have had proven efficacy against SARS-COV-2 such as Nafamostat Mesylate [12] .",

In spite of the fact that Nafamostat Mesylate is primarily an anti-thrombin drug, this particular drug also exhibits the most powerful anti-plasmin characteristic [13] . Thus, this drug could be considered to be specifically suitable for complications which have enhanced fibrinolytic implications [13] . Furthermore, the Nafamostat Mesylate is particularly beneficial for COVID-19 patients since this drug does not contribute to haemorrhagic conditions internally [13] . Apart from these, according to (Asakura, and Ogawa, 2020), Nafamostat Mesylate could further block effectively the entry of viral strains into epithelial cells of humans through inhibition of membrane fusion between such cells and SARS-COV-2. Thus, efficacy of the drug towards impartation of effective treatment of COVID-19 patients has been the pertinent expectation on account of multiplicity of virologists and scientists [13] .",

The basic mechanism behind the MDT treatment is that they simply slow down the rate of mutations or evolutions that leads to the development of the resistant bacteria or viruses etc [4] . The therapy based on polydrug treatment can be applied based on the two ways: one is at the hospital level and other is at the individual patient level. In this respect, it must be taken into notice that our World Health Organization have recommended that MDT can be applicable to the fatal patients of leprosy, tuberculosis at free of any treatment expenditure as these two diseases had already turned into an epidemic one. Because of the rapid pandemic spread of the Covid 19 viral pneumonia which is also associated with unparallel level of morbidity of patients, there is surely an urgent surge for the development of combinatorial drugs to curb down the growing menace and the suffering of the people due to the rising cases of deaths day by day [12] . In this moment of crisis, the technique called the drug repurposing, i.e., that is depicting the commercially available patented medications as an alternative would rapidly minimize the expenditure and would result in something feasible other than explorations of something entirely new path or \"de novo treatment strategy\". In the very recent times many drugs have gone into testing phase to cure down the patients of Covid 19 such as the drugs like Hydroxychloroquine, Favipiravir, Azithromycin, Remdesivir, Nafamostat mesylate, and Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and many such medications. Though such medications have been recently tried against the fatal pandemic disease, there is hardly any successful result alone. ",

Now, it must be mentioned that with Favipiravir, as the candidate medications many specialized trials are on its way and also observational investigation is also going to progress as the sponsor-commenced clinical investigation. The mechanism of action of the above mentioned medication is that it strongly inhibits the enzyme RNA polymerase and therefore it was strongly considered to be as the choice for the inhibition of the SARS CoV 2 virus strain (see Fig. 1 ). The other drug namely Nafamostat mesylate is basically an anticoagulant agent and also it has its application already in the country Japan for the treatment of the acute intra-vascularitis and pancreatitis. Therefore, the combinatorial therapy of both of the potential medications might help in the treatment of the fatal pandemic disease. The mechanism of action may be action on the varied parts of the replication or the multiplication of the virus unit, and therefore again it is expected to have an atleast additive effect when the two medications will be used together. As most of the Covid 19 patients suffers from the coagulation of the blood intravascular conditions and it can be pathologically fatal, so in that condition the drug Nafamostat mesylate will take care of the fatal condition [15] .",

The drug, Nafamostat mesylate also has been observed that it strongly inhibits the entry of the virus within the cells of the human. This experiment was carried out at the Institute of Medical Science of The University of Tokyo (IMSUT). Favipiravir was also approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare at the date of March 2014, however, it was observed that it has limited efficiency in the treatment the novel pandemic influenza. Behind this the drug has the mechanism of action that it converts the ribosyl triphosphate within the physiological system and also depicts particular interference to the RNA polymerase enzyme of the virus. It also shows that this particular drug also shows action against different RNA virus other than the influenza virus. Many of the research scholars or the scientists are working with this particular drug against many viruses or against this virus within varied clinical trials [15] . The drug Nafamostat mesylate reveals inhibitory action against the enzymes that degrades proteins, so this particular medication is used for ameliorating the condition of the patient suffering from the acute pancreatitis. This particular drug has been used for many of the years in the country Japan. It was the Jun-ichiro Inoue group working at the Institute, IMSUT highlighted that this particular medication also have the capacity to inhibit at the action mechanism of SARS CoV \u2212 2. Those viral infections that involve the infection of the respiratory tract, the EC50 value (the value or the concentration or the dosage of the drug where it inhibits the infection of the virus by about 50%) of the medication named Nafamostat mesylate showed to be 10 nM only which is itself a extremely low concentration [14] . Moreover, many paients have reported the pathological condition of rapid blood clot within the blood arteries in the severe conditions only and in that aspect also Nafamostat mesylate is also considered to be an ideal consideration for the patients. So apart from the antiviral activity this activity is also considered to be a significant action. This has been observed within a clinical study that is single blinded randomized controlled, comparative investigation and which is also a multicentre one.",
