However, detection of the virus is crucial to implement isolation of infected individuals. This paper presents the innovative repurposing of lab materials, workspace, and personnel in response to the COVID-19induced shutdown and consequential shortage of commercially made virus transport media (VTM). This method for VTM production highlights the ability of standard research labs to fulfill the needs of those affected by the pandemic and potential recurrence of outbreaks. Further, the collaboration of the various entities at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC) allowed for efficient production and distribution of VTM tubes to facilitate mass COVID-19 testing. We propose that implementation of this process by university research labs would enable quicker interventions, potentially better outcomes, and prevention of further spread of disease.",

Cases of asymptomatic or subclinical COVID-19 infections are often unreported and may not accurately reflect what stage of the pandemic a particular area [2] . To control the spread of disease, it is essential to have abundant testing, contact tracing, and data for the prediction of possible hotspot areas [3] . Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020, and resulting state-wide lockdown, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC) implemented a reduction in research in order to prevent workplace infections. During this time, like other areas across the world, the State of Ohio wrestled to meet COVID-19 testing kit needs as most commercially sold virus transport media (VTM) was unavailable. In order to meet the demands of testing for the state of Ohio, researchers at OSUWMC developed a custom VTM recipe and a protocol to produce COVID-19 test kits with the available research space in the Dorothy M. Davis Heart and Lung Research Institute (DHLRI) and the Biomedical Research Tower (BRT).",

All volunteers completed an hour-long hands-on training session to ensure the quality of the final product. Graduate students and OSUWMC research staff with biosafety cabinet aseptic technique experience controlled the VTM pipetting operation, while undergraduate students and administrative staff labeled the sealed conical tubes with manufacture, expiration, and ingredient information. Test kit production continued under this model from June to mid-September. During this timeframe, the team produced and distributed 91,648 VTM tubes. OSUWMC hired 6 part-time undergraduate student employees in late September, 2020 to allow for consistent schedules and production. As COVID-19 positivity rates increased to the highest point of the pandemic, consistent employees reduced person-to-person contact while also ensuring maintenance of a high-quality final product.

As infection rates soared in Ohio and worldwide, the lack of COVID-19 test kits swiftly became a potential bottleneck for population-wide COVID-19 testing.

Indeed, the CDC has since issued a protocol (CDC SOP# DSR-052-05) for production of VTM similar to that prepared by OSUWMC [5] . Starting with this custom VTM recipe that could be prepared in bulk with available high quality research reagents, along with leftover research supplies (15 mL conical tubes, serological pipettes, etc.), OSUWMC was able to create an effective yet unusual FDA-approved COVID-19 virus transport test kit. Within weeks of initial production, the volunteering research staff and students were able to produce up to 10,0 0 0 test kits per day. Daily output and overall rates of production varied between individuals depending on experience and focus. On average, lab staff produced about 125 test kits per hour per person. The COVID-19 test kit production continued in OSUWMC research space at some capacity throughout the initial year of the pandemic. During this time, the OSUWMC volunteers sacrificed their work, and potentially their own health, in order to supplement the supply of COVID-19 test kits in Ohio. In addition to test kit production, we also met with several research teams throughout the United States, as well as a global team from Ethiopia.",

In laboratory experiments, others have shown that live SARS-CoV-2 survives in similar VTM for at least 72 h at room temperature, and viral RNA can be detected by RT-PCR as long as 28 days post collection [ 6 , 7 ] . In agreement with this, OSUWMC has contributed numerous full genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from our testing kit samples, and identified a Midwestern variant of concern [8] . Overall, our test kits were compatible with RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2, propagation of live virus, and sequencing of full genomes.",
