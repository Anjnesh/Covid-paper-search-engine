The untreated wastewater was filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m membrane (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States) to remove bacterial cells and wastes. The filters were discarded, as initial tests revealed little or no viral RNA on the filters. Then 4 g of polyethylene glycol 8000 (8% w/v, Millipore Sigma) and 0.9 g of NaCl (0.3 M, Millipore Sigma) were added to 40 mL of filtrate and centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7 g for two hours or until a pellet was visible. The viral sediment was resuspended in Trizol (Thermofisher, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) for RNA extraction, followed by reverse transcription (reverse transcriptase, NEB) and qPCR (TaqMan rapid forward master mix, Thermofisher) with CDC primers (IDT) for the nucleocapsid N gene.

The decrease in viral load in aquatic environments depends on the time elapsed since its release, the viral resistance to natural and artificial disinfection factors, and dilution. Unlike most enteric viruses usually found in wastewater, coronaviruses are enveloped and considered less resistant in the environment [37] . Currently, no studies have explored the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater treatment plants as a function of time, and there are no estimates available on the minimum infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater required to cause infection in humans ( [27, 38] ).",

On the other hand, the population that lives near the receiving bodies of wastewater, workers in wastewater treatment plants, and workers in the health sector could be at risk because the virus is transmitted through the formation of aerosols or fecal-oral route. Inhalation of viral aerosols and exposure to contaminated waste and sludge can potentially produce infections. Hence, extra cautions must be taken to minimize the generation of aerosols during wastewater treatment and the handling of sewage sludge. Workers at hospitals, quarantine facilities, and WWTPs should be provided with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Health and WWTP workers should follow the WHO and WASH guidelines to minimize the spread of this virus [39] .",
