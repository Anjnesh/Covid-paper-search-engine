To outline the intuition behind such a ranking, suppose we wanted to rank the most livable cities in the world (or let us say, the best soccer players in history). We would identify characteristics that might be useful to make such an assessment. We would weight the individual characteristics and then collect data for the entities that are being ranked. We could then calculate an overall score, which would be an aggregation based on the collected data and the corresponding weights. The overall score would then yield a suitable ranking, since having one number for each object we are interested in facilitates a ranking.",

The actual data for back testing such a strategy would be available from the securities lending desk of a broker dealer. We have taken great care to ensure that the sample time series is similar to actual historical data in terms of some of its statistical properties such as starting value, drift and volatility (Equations: 6; 7). Section (7) illustrates numerical scores for three flavors of the alternative aggregation scheme discussed in Section (5) and shows how we can obtain a top shorts ranking. Section (8) provides details on how to construct a portfolio based on the ranking method in Section (5) . Section (9) has suggestions for improvement that address one of the main drawbacks of using volatility as a decision making tool since it fails to fully capture the effect of changes in the direction in the time series of any variable. Clearly, such views are bound to be erroneous and have a significant degree of error. Hence, we could be conservative in our trading strategy and the time horizon of our trade can be a fraction of the time over which there is consensus expectation for the markets to trend upwards. As an alternative to our investment idea, we could go long an index future or exchange-traded fund 3 or take a derivative position on an index in anticipation of a market rebound, which would be an example of a passive strategy.",

If a rebound effect exists, with respect to investing and subsequent to a market crash, people will load up on the entire market (or at-least big portions of it) in the hopes of the market moving up. Hence, a more careful selection of securities is bound to yield greater dividends. Indiscriminate or haphazard investing on the back of a market crash, which might have caused personal portfolios losses, would perhaps not be advisable. A more circumspect approach can benefit from the behavioral biases that are entrenched among the wider population and are 4 Clearly, there are multiple ways of experiencing a rebound effect with respect to financial investments. As an alternative to losses caused due to a market crash, someone's portfolio might be exposed only to a minor sub-section of the market and the value of their assets might plummet significantly due to the nature of their specific holdings. Many interesting questions and avenues of research arise here, in terms of how people respond to casualties caused by different types of investments, and how their later investment behavior is transformed due to any mishaps experienced earlier. 5 For detailed discussions on diversifiable and non-diversifiable risks, see: Ross, et al., 2009 not easy to remedy (Section 3.4). Even if the rebound effect does not exist, or is insignificant, our strategy can still be used as a prudent means of stock selection that can provide outsized returns. Our approach is certainly expedient for someone who did not experience a market crash, but is eager to make the most of an anticipated recovery in the markets.",

Roll (1988) found that all major world markets declined substantially in October 1987 (of 23 markets, 19 declined more than 20 per cent). This is an exceptional occurrence, given the usual modest correlations of returns across countries observed at that time. Schwert (1990) analyzed the behavior of stock return volatility, using daily data from 1885 through 1988, and found that stock volatility jumped dramatically during and after the crash 7 .

To avoid any confusion, we refer to these as the loan rate and the alternate loan rate respectively. The short interest ratio (also called days-to-cover ratio) represents the number of days it takes short sellers on average to cover their positions, that is repurchase all of the borrowed shares. It is calculated by dividing the number of shares sold short by the average daily trading volume, generally over the last 30 trading days. The ratio is used by both fundamental and technical traders to identify trends. The days-to-cover ratio can also be calculated for an entire exchange to determine the sentiment of the market as a whole.

Also, availability can be zero for certain securities, leading to a error in the score calculation when we divide by zero, which is avoided in many cases by using a moving average. Since our scores are based on a simulation we see some low loan rates, low availability and high short interest numbers. In general, low availability and high short interest will be reflected as higher loan rates. Similarly high loan rates, high availability and low short interest rarely occur in practice.

To articulate the intuition, any security that had steady upward growth, over a particular time period, is ranked higher than a security with similar growth, over the same time period, but with more ups and downs in the path, or changes in direction. Similarly, any security that had steady downward growth is ranked lower than a security with similar downward growth but with more changes in direction in the path.

Reinhart & Rogoff (2009) prove wrong many claims that the old rules of valuation no longer apply and that the new situation bears little similarity to past disasters. Odekon (2015) is a timely and authoritative exploration of three centuries of good times and hard times in major economies throughout the world. Events from Tulipmania during the 1630s to the US federal stimulus package of 2009 are covered. Thomas & Morgan-Witts (2014) is the story of an overheated stock market and the Wall Street crash of 1929, that led to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Ohanian (2009) develops a theory of labor market failure for the Depression based on Hoover's industrial labor program that provided industry with protection from unions in return for keeping nominal wages fixed. Richardson & Troost (2009) consider the varying monetary interventions by different federal reserve banks during the 1930 banking crisis. Atlanta expedited lending to banks in need, while St. Louis did not. In Atlanta, banks survived at higher rates, lending continued at higher levels, commerce contracted less, and recovery began earlier. These patterns indicate that central bank intervention influenced bank health, credit availability, and business activity. Granados & Roux (2009) used historical life expectancy and mortality data to examine associations of economic growth with population health for the period 1920-1940.

            "text": ", there is a strong line of inquiry in the existing literature related to better portfolio management techniques and the analysis of investment strategies. (Kashyap 2019) has a detailed discussion of some general principles that can be utilized towards goals of seeking excess returns. Browne (2000) considers a dynamic active portfolio management problem where the objective is related to the tradeoff between the achievement of performance goals and the risk of a shortfall. Specifically, the objective relates the probability of achieving a given performance objective to the time it takes to achieve the objective. Most studies that analyze dynamic investment strategies have obtained explicit results by restricting utility functions to a few specific forms. The resultant dynamic strategies have exhibited a very limited range of behavior, not surprisingly. In contrast, Cox & Leland (2000) consider any specific dynamic strategy and ask whether we can characterize the results of following it through time? More precisely, they try to determine whether it is self-financing, yields path-independent returns, and is consistent with optimal behavior for some expected utility maximizing investor. They provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a dynamic strategy to satisfy each of these properties. Ammann, Kessler & Tobler (2006) use tracking error variance (TEV) as a measure of activity and introduce two decompositions of TEV for identifying different investment strategies Ranaldo & Haeberle (2008) argue that the commonly used market indices imply forms of active investment management in disguise. Malkiel (2003) presents the case for and the evidence in favor of passive investment strategies and examines the major criticisms of the technique. Balvers, Wu & Gilliland (2000) find strong evidence of mean reversion in relative stock index prices. They use additional cross-sectional power gained from national stock index data of 18 countries during the period 1969 to 1996. Their findings, which are robust to alternative specifications and data, imply a significantly positive speed of reversion with a half-lifeof three to three and one-half years. They devise a parametric contrarian strategy, which efficiently exploits the information on mean reversion across countries directly from the parameter estimates of their econometric model, that outperforms buy-and-hold and standard contrarian strategies.9",

Employing an extensive online survey, they demonstrate that, on average, active capital market investors exhibit moderate degrees of behavioral biases. By calculating the cross-sectional correlation coefficients between the biases they find that all of them are positive and highly significant for both professional and non-professional investors and for all categories of investors, as classified by their experience levels, genders, and ages.10 A more complete list of cognitive biases is given here: List of Cognitive Biases, Wikipedia Link Game theoretical techniques (Fudenberg & Tirole 1991; Gibbons 1992) can be used to understand the decision strategies of individuals. While such an approach can be insightful to understand decision making with limited participants, extending those results to markets is not a straightforward affair. Payne, Laughhunn & Crum (1980) present model of the effects of a reference point on risky choice behavior. Target returns and reference points represent variations on the concept of an aspiration level, an old idea in theories of decision making. They present additional evidence on the need to incorporate such a concept in the analysis of risky choice behavior. Charness, Cobo-Reyes & Jim\u00e9nez (2008) explore the effect of the possibility of third-party intervention on behavior. A third-party's material payoff is not affected by the decisions made by the other participants, but this person may choose to punish a responder who has been overly selfish. The concern over this possibility may serve to discipline potentially selfish responders. Buchan, Croson & Solnick (2008) pose the questiondoes gender influence trust, the likelihood of being trusted and the level of trustworthiness? They compare choices by men and women in an investment game and use questionnaire data to try to understand the motivations for the behavioral differences. They find that men trust more than women, and women are more trustworthy than men. Abbink, Irlenbusch & Renner (2000) introduce a game (Berg, Dickhaut & McCabe 1995) that allows the study of both positively and negatively reciprocal behaviour.",

It is calculated by taking the number of shares that are currently shorted and dividing that amount by the average daily volume for the shares in question. For example, if a company has average daily volume of 1 million shares and 2 million shares are currently short sold, the shares have a cover rate of 2 days (2 Million/1 Million). A higher value for this metric indicates that if investors wish to cover their shorts, it could take many days and during that time, their positions could end up losing money significantly.

The prime broker provides a centralized securities clearing facility for the hedge fund so the hedge fund's collateral requirements are netted across all deals handled by the prime broker. These two features are advantageous to their clients. The prime broker benefits by earning fees (\"spreads\") on financing the client's margined long and short cash and security positions, and by charging, in some cases, fees for clearing and other services. It also earns money by re-hypothecating the margined portfolios of the hedge funds currently serviced and charging interest on those borrowing securities and other investments. Re-hypothecation occurs when the creditor (a bank or broker-dealer) re-uses the collateral posted by the debtor (a client such as a hedge fund) to back the broker's own trades and borrowing.

An investment firm might have the time series of loan rates, prices, trading volume and availability and hence would have to simulate the variables for which the historical data is absent, as shown in this section, to come up with a short score. We create one hundred different hypothetical securities and we come up with the time series of all the variables involved: Price, Availability, Short Interest, Trading Volume, Loan Rate, Alternate Loan Rate. We model these variables as Geometric Brownian Motions (GBMs) with uncertainty introduced via sampling from suitable log normal distributions or by sampling from suitable absolute normal distributions (Equations: 6; 7). Norstad (1999) has a technical discussion of the normal and log normal distributions. Hull & Basu (2016) provide an excellent account of using GBMs to model stock prices and other time series that are always positive. It is worth noting that the starting value, mean and standard deviation of the time series are themselves simulations from other appropriately chosen uniform distributions (Figure 2). Some of the above variables can be modeled as Poisson distributions or we can simply consider them as the absolute value of a normal distribution with appropriately chosen units. As an example, we model the Loan Balance process as a folded normal distribution or by taking the absolute value of a normal distribution. The mean and standard deviation of the loan balance distribution for each security are chosen from another appropriately chosen uniform distribution.A GBM is characterized as below.

Investor reactions after making losses (human behavior before and after hardship) can be a very interesting avenue for exploration. Some possibilities are to look at how soon investor intentions are to return back to making investments, changes to the size of investments, any alterations to their risk appetites and desired asset classes. Though, as we have outlined earlier, even if the rebound effect is not significant in the financial markets or across broad categories of investors, our strategy can be an excellent security selection tool when markets are expected to trend upwards.We have outlined a key limitation of using volatility, as a measure of risk, and chronicled our initial efforts to arrive at an alternate metric that is more sensitive to the path taken by variables. Further efforts in this line of inquiry can be challenging yet quite rewarding.
