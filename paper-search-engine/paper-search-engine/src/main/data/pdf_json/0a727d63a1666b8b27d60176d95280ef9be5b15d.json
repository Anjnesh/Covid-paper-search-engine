            "text": "The rationale for the current RCT was based on the fact that corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, are a pillar in the treatment of multiple inflammatory diseases, with several mechanisms of action impacting both the innate and adaptive arms of immunity. Regarding tacrolimus, the reason for its use was based on both the anti-inflammatory and anti-viral actions of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). As an immunomodulatory agent, tacrolimus impairs lymphocyte function and consequently decreases in pro-inflammatory cytokines (7, 13) . In this respect, severe COVID-19 disease presents a similar clinical and cytokine profile to other disorders like secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (14) , where CNIs play a central role in its treatment (15) . Additionally, several human coronavirus replication depends on immunophilin pathways, which can be inhibited by CNIs in cell culture (16, 17) . Based on these two mechanisms, it has been suggested that CNIs could be used to treat COVID-19 (18) . In fact, recent non-randomized studies suggest that cyclosporine could reduce mortality, mainly in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (19, 20) . Our study is the first RCT assessing the effect of corticosteroids plus a CNI (tacrolimus) in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. They are low-cost drugs with a well-known safety profile that could be produced on a large scale if they were effective at treating COVID-19.",

Furthermore, no differences were observed in the clearance of the virus or in the rate of adverse events between the two groups. The TACROVID trial was initiated in March 29, 2020 when there were no medical reports supporting the use of immunosuppressive therapy in severe COVID-19. Nonetheless, all of the trial's patients received corticosteroids. Methylprednisolone and tacrolimus lead to impaired lymphocyte function (7, 13) and therefore it could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 replication and also promote the development of other infections. On the other hand, CNIs have been shown to inhibit the growth of human coronaviruses at low micromolar, non-cytotoxic concentrations in cell cultures by immunophilin pathway inhibition (16, 17) . Based on this finding, it has been suggested that CNIs could be used as an antiviral agent to treat COVID-19. However, we would like to highlight that the concentrations used in cell culture are not clinically achievable, as they correspond to highly toxic blood levels in humans (24) . Accordingly, the proposed use of tacrolimus should be restricted to the inflammatory stages of COVID-19. In this trial, tacrolimus had no significant effect on SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads either in the upper respiratory tract or in blood specimens in our patients.",

This was considered unrealistic given the intense workload experienced at the beginning of the pandemic in our local setting. To minimize the impact of an open-label design, the statistician performing the analysis was blinded to the trial arm. Second, the TACROVID trial had a limited sample size and clearly was not sufficiently powered to detect a difference in time to clinical stability and mortality between the two groups after the early termination that occurred with 29 (34.1%) patients fewer than expected. Furthermore, the limited sample size caused certain imbalances in the baseline characteristics between the two groups after randomization. Third, all included patients received corticosteroids, heparins, and hydroxychloroquine; and most (89.1%) of them also received tocilizumab as part of the SoC. In this respect, the additional use of any other medication regimens (except for cyclosporine) in both arms, as part of the SoC, limits the assessment of which was the real effect of each drug on clinical outcomes, laboratory data and the occurrence of AE. Moreover, tacrolimus strongly interacts with some treatments (especially lopinavir) used at that time in COVID-19. Most (85.2%) patients in the experimental group received concomitant treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir, as it was extremely difficult to achieve the recommended plasma levels of tacrolimus. Finally, the lack of medical evidence supporting immunosuppressive therapies in COVID-19, when the trial was conducted, made us more cautious, withdrawing experimental therapy when mechanical invasive ventilation was implemented. Therefore, its efficacy and safety cannot be assessed by this trial in this subset of patients with lifethreatening COVID-19.",
