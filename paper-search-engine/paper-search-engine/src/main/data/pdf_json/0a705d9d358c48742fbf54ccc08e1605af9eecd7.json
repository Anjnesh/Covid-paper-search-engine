As the specific choice of the mapping affects the analysis of all-atom simulations as well as the construction of coarse-grained models, the characterisation of the mapping space has recently attracted increasing attention. We here introduce a notion of scalar product and distance between reduced representations, which allows the study of the metric and topological properties of their space in a quantitative manner. Making use of a Wang-Landau enhanced sampling algorithm, we exhaustively explore such space, and examine the qualitative features of mappings in terms of their squared norm. A one-to-one correspondence with an interacting lattice gas on a finite volume leads to the emergence of discontinuous phase transitions in mapping space, which mark the boundaries between qualitatively different reduced representations of the same molecule.",

In a nutshell, while the generative process has to be high-resolution to be useful, its outcome has to be low-resolution to be intelligible. An intuitive example of this concept is given by the representation of a protein structure in terms of its C \u03b1 's, i.e. the alpha carbons of the backbone: this mapping is not only extensively employed in the development of CG models [16, 17] (that is, models in which the whole amino acid is represented as a single bead whose position coincides with that of the C \u03b1 ), but it is also extremely common in the analysis of structures sampled in fully atomistic simulations [18, 19] .",

There exists a first class of algorithms that rely on a completely static, graphbased description of the system [20, 21] , such as the [20] . A second group of approaches makes use of the dynamics of the system, obtained through models with more [22, 23] or less [24, 25] detailed force fields. For instance, a recent protocol proposed by us [23] revolves around the analysis of an all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) [26, 27] simulation trajectory of a protein in terms of a subset of the molecule's atoms; a physics-driven choice of the latter allows one to identify the one or few mappings that return the most parsimonious yet informative simplified description of the system. Each of these methods can be the most appropriate to investigate specific properties of the system at hand; at the same time, the majority of them performs the search for solutions of an optimisation problem within the overwhelmingly large space of all possible CG representations that can be assigned to the system. As an exhaustive exploration of this mapping space is hardly feasible in practice, the outcome of such schemes is often a pool of optimal CG representations, that is, an ensemble of local minima in the-likely-rugged landscape of the cost function that defines the mapping optimisation procedure.",

To this end, we introduce a notion of scalar product, and consequently of norm and distance, between reduced representations of a system. We first make use of these instruments in the exploration of some basic, bare metric and topological properties of mappings of a single, static molecular structure, i.e. without reference to its interactions and/or conformational sampling, but rather solely considering the coordinates of its constituent atoms. This provides a notion of mapping distance based on purely geometric properties of the molecule. Through the application of an enhanced sampling algorithm, namely the Wang-Landau method [28, 29] , we characterise this mapping space in its entirety, and asso-ciate its properties to structural features of the underlying molecule. Furthermore, the isomorphism between the problem of exploring the possible mappings of a molecule and that of a lattice gas in a finite volume enables to highlight the emergence of first-order phase transitions in the latter, distinguishing CG representations with qualitatively different properties. We then investigate the topology of the mapping space making use of the distance between reduced representations, which enables a low-dimensional embedding that highlights its general features. This analysis is performed both in absence and in presence of a cost function, namely the mapping entropy [23, 24, [30] [31] [32] , which gauges the quality of a given CG representation according to an information theoretical measure. Finally, we suggest a possible manner to extend the tools we introduced to characterise the mapping space in the static case so as to incorporate information about the reference system's exploration of conformational space and thus, indirectly, about its energetics as well.",

In the perspective of quantitatively characterising the properties of such space, the cardinality of M in the continuous definition presented in Eq. 1 makes its thorough exploration, although appealing, hard to handle in practice.

The structure of adenylate kinase can be divided in three main building blocks [38, 39] , with the mobile LID and NMP domains exhibiting a conformational rearrangement around a hinge, the stable CORE domain, which results in an overall open \u2194 closed transition of the enzyme [40, 41] .

Indeed, at least for small and intermediate N , it is extremely unlikely that a completely random selection of retained atoms across the biomolecule will result in their dense confinement within sharply defined spatial domains of the system, just as it is unlikely for a gas to occupy only a small fraction of the volume in which it is enclosed. Interestingly, this latter analogy can be pushed further by noting that the squared norm E(M ), see Eqs. 30 and 18, is akin to the negative configurational energy of a lattice gas living on the irregular grid defined by the protein's conformation, whose particle interact via a hard-core, short-range potential followed by an attractive Gaussian tail. In this context, the selection operators \u03c7 M,i = 0, 1, i = 1, ..., n of a mapping M with N retained atoms can be interpreted as the set of occupation numbers describing a distribution of the N particles of the gas on the n available lattice sites. It follows that compact CG representations of AKE, located in the large-E limit of P N (E), are just as challenging to randomly sample within the space M as are the lowenergy configurations of the gas in which the N particles spontaneously occupy only a fraction of the available volume. The implications of this analogy will be thoroughly explored in Sect. 4 .",

The accuracy of this parabolic, symmetric approximation in reproducing the exact S N over the whole E-range increases with the number of retained atoms, see Figs. 4 and 12, especially as far as the limit of high mapping norms is concerned. Finally, it is interesting to test the predictions of WL sampling against the results obtained via a completely random exploration of the mapping space. To this end, Fig. 4 and Fig. 12 include a comparison between the WL entropies S N and their random counterparts S ran N , the latter defined as S ran N (E) = ln[P N (E)] + C N , where P N (E) are the probability densities presented in Fig. 2 and the constants C N are set so that the maxima of S ran N and S N coincide. For each value of N the two profiles are in perfect agreement, thus confirming the accuracy of the self-consistent WL scheme in determining the density of states of a system. Critically, results for S ran N only extend over a very narrow range of mapping norms, centred around the value\u1ebc(N ) for which the maximum of the entropy is attained. It is, therefore, largely unfeasible, by randomly drawing CG representations, to exhaustively explore the mapping space M of a macromolecule. In this respect it is worth to inspect the position, on the E axis, of the C \u03b1 and backbone mappings (which in AKE retain N = 214 and N = 856 sites, respectively), two reduced representations that are routinely employed for CG'ing proteins [5, 8] . These turn out to be located in the vicinity of the class of \"prototypical\" random ones, for which the entropy S N reaches its maximum; however, their intrinsic regularity, dictated by the position of the retained sites on the peptide chain, makes these mappings slightly more homogeneous than the random ones, see Figs. 4 and 12.",

More specifically, we started a WL exploration as in Sect. 3.1 over this range and, when all the reference bins were visited at least once, we began saving a mapping every 1656 Monte Carlo moves. Mappings were saved in different macro-bins, each one covering an interval of amplitude 20 (in terms of units of E). Sampling ended when 5000 mappings were saved in each box, without considering the convergence of the WL algorithm. The data set was then generated by computing the cosine (Eq. 26) between randomly selected pairs of mappings extracted through this procedure. Importantly, the WL sampling scheme produces a pool of potentially correlated mappings, so that the chance of collecting similar elements of M cannot be excluded.",

Also in this case, in fact, we have a number n of nodes that can be occupied by N \u2264 n sites, each node being accessible to a single site at a timethus implementing a hard-core repulsion. This analogy is a classic of statistical mechanics, and enables one, e.g. to map an Ising model to a gas of interacting particles, thus making it manifest that the spontaneous magnetisation in the former and the liquid-gas phase transition in the latter belong to the same universality class [45] . Here, we investigate the consequences of the lattice gas interpretation of reduced representations in order to tackle the issue of characterising the mapping space from a different perspective. Specifically, we mutuate concepts from equilibrium statistical mechanics to show that sharp transitions can occur that separate one or more phases corresponding to classes of reduced representations endowed with markedly distinct structural properties. While the previously performed analysis of the smooth and continuous densities of states \u03a9 N (E) already suggested the existence of such classes, see Sect. 3, for particular numbers of retained sites these are shown to be as distinct as two or more phases of a fluid can be when observed through the perspective of this statistical mechanical analogue. The role of the energy can be played by the norm of the mapping: in analogy with a lattice gas, we expect that if two retained sites are close to each other, they feel an attractive interaction, thereby reducing the energy. We thus define the energy of the system as",

The sharp, asymmetric peak in C V , located at the value \u03b2 gl of the inverse temperature, shows that the lattice gas crosses a phase transition between a gas and a liquid phase. A crucial role in this behaviour is played by the number of coarse-grained sites. In fact, as N increases, the system acquires the possibility of crossing a second phase transition: for example, in the case of N = 1070, besides the gas-liquid one, it is possible to observe a second, even sharper discontinuity in E for a value of the inverse temperature \u03b2 ls > \u03b2 gl . This temperature separates the liquid from the solid phase: when the lattice gas particles are sufficiently many, and the temperature sufficiently low, the system can \"freeze\" in particularly dense mappings with very low entropy. Also in this case, the inspection of the heat capacity ( Fig. 13 in Appendix B) supports the interpretation of this as a phase transition.

While apparently very distinct, the spectral quality and the norm of the mapping might bear substantial similarities: in fact, the former entails information about a very simple model, whose mechanical and thermodynamical properties are completely determined by the contact matrix of the underlying protein structure. It is, thus, reasonable to guess that the mapping norm provides, in an effective and efficient manner, information akin to that entailed in the spectral quality about the sparsity or localisation of the retained sites in a given mapping.

With respect to this, it is worth keeping in mind that D intimately depends on this reference, and mappings that lie close to each other when a given structure is employed might turn out to be closer or further away from each other when a different conformation is used. Figure 9 shows that the two-dimensional embedding obtained through the application of the sketch map algorithm separates the CG mappings according to a gradient of S map . In particular, the x component of the sketch map and the mapping entropy S map display a clear anticorrelation. The results suggest that highly informative mappings, characterised by low values of S map , share geometrical features that are not present in less informative (high S map ) representations. In other words, the peculiar resolution distribution found in low-S map mappings separates them from the other elements of M. The relevant features that the mapping entropy highlights thus reverberate in the merely structural characterisation provided by the mapping distance; this connection among the norm E, the distance D, and highly informative representations is potentially interesting and deserves to be further investigated.",

On the one hand, these calculations brought to the surface information about \"special\" (i.e. atypical) representations that, just due to their lower number with respect to randomly sampled ones, are exponentially suppressed; on the other hand, we made use of the densities of states to implement a lattice-gas analogy in terms of which we have interpreted mappings of qualitatively different types as different phases of the same physical system undergoing a phase transition. We have then made use of the distance between mappings to investigate the properties of optimal reduced representations obtained by minimising the mapping entropy, a measure of the amount of information that a given mapping can return about the underlying system at thermal equilibrium: this last analysis has shown that optimal mappings are markedly distant, and therefore qualitatively different, from randomly sampled ones, thus corroborating the idea that the former belong to a particular subregion of the mapping space endowed with nontrivial properties. Finally, we proposed a possible extension of the theory to samples of conformations at thermal equilibrium, focusing on the case of the mapping norm. In this manner, the J ij couplings are weighted with the probabilities associated to each configuration, thus indirectly accounting for the system's energy.",

The series of MC moves within iteration k is interrupted when the histogram of sampled norms H k N (E) is \"flat\", meaning that each of its entries does not exceed a threshold distance from the average of the histogram H k N .

In contrast to \"more traditional\" systems such as Ising ferromagnets on a lattice [28] , this information is not readily available in our case.

To mitigate the effect of bins that are only visited at a very late stage of the simulation, thus risking to temporarily \"trap\" the mapping space exploration, we followed the protocol described in Ref. [44] : every time a bin [Ei, Ei + \u03b4E] was populated for the first time, it was marked as \"visited\", the corresponding entropy was initialised to the minimum ofSN (E) over the previously visited bins, and the histogram HN (E) was reset.

To boost convergence of the algorithm, for each N we slightly reduced the interval of norms [Emin(N ), Emax(N )] with respect to the one predicted by the explorative runs, and divided this spectrum in a total of WN overlapping windows of equal width, see Table 2 [29] . The overlap between two consecutive windows was fixed to half their size. Within each window, we then performed a separate WL simulation in which confinement of the range of norms was achieved by rejecting all mapping moves M \u2192 M that would bring the exploration outside the E interval of interest. In discarding these moves, we concurrently updated the histogram and entropy of the current state according to Eqs. A2 and A3 to avoid boundary effects [52] . Furthermore, also in these production runs we kept track of the norm bins that were sampled during the course of the simulation, resetting the histogram every time a new bin was populated, the entropy of which was initialised to the minimum ofSN (E) over the previously visited ones. All Table 2 Lower and upper bound of the norms Emin and Emax identified by the set of preliminary WL runs for each degree of CG'ing N , see Fig. 3 , and corresponding values\u0112min and\u0112max employed in the reconstruction of the entropy SN (E) through the iterative WL scheme. For boosting convergence of the algorithm, the interval [\u0112min,\u0112max] was divided in WN windows overlapping by half their width; the associated simulations were performed with a flatness parameter p flat = 0.90, assuming convergence of the iterations when the modification factor ln(f k ) became smaller than ln(f end ) = 10 \u22126 WL simulations were performed setting p flat = 0.90, and checking the histogram flatness over the visited bins every 3 \u00b7 10 6 \"single spin\" MC moves that involved the swap of a retained and a non-retained atom in the mapping.

For each degree of CG'ing N , the outcome of the converged WL protocol is a set of entropiesSN,i(E), i = 1, ..., WN , restricted to bounded and overlapping E domains that need to be combined to provide the complete SN (E) over the whole range of investigated norms. TheseSN,i(E) differ-besides numerical uncertainties that are inherent to the self-consistent scheme [53] -from the exact results SN,i(E) by additive constants CN,i that are not uniform across the different WL windows. Rather than determining the relative shifts that most accurately superimpose the var-iousSN,i(E) profiles within the overlapping regions-see e.g. Ref.

At the same time, these fluctuations appear to be marginal in the vicinity of the center of a window, while tend to slightly increase if we move towards its boundaries (data not shown). Exploiting this observation, we thus tackled the problem of merging the derivatives of two consecutive windows i and i+1 within their overlap region as follows: first, we divided the region in three separate intervals, the central one being roughly double the size of the other two. Given that the windows overlap by half their width, it follows that the first interval will be located close to the center of window i, where the derivative S N,i (E) is numerically more stable, but close to the boundary of window i + 1, where S N,i+1 (E) is slightly more noisy. The opposite holds for the last interval. As such, in the first and last regions, we considered the combined derivative S N (E) to be equal to S N,i (E) and S N,i+1 (E), respectively. Within the central interval, by increasing E we move from the vicinity of the center of window i to that of window i+1. In this latter region, we, thus, set the final derivative S N to a weighted average of the derivatives of the two windows, namely S N (E) = (1 \u2212 \u03b1(E)) S N,i (E) + \u03b1(E)S N,i+1 (E), (A6)",

Figure 11 displays a comparison between S N (E) and the original, piecewise derivatives for the case N = 856, highlighting the accuracy of our approach. This accuracy is further confirmed by the smooth behavior of the second derivative S N (E) calculated from the reconstructed S N , that we display in Fig. 4 for N = 856. Starting from the set of S N (E), the corresponding entropies SN (E) were subsequently obtained via direct integration, see Eq. A5, producing the profiles presented in Fig. 4 and in Fig. 12 . In these figures, entropies were shifted so that their minimum value is zero. Finally, it is interesting to test the dependence of our results on the input parameters of the WL protocol. While initially all MC simulations were performed with a flatness condition p flat = 0.90, for the case N = 856, we repeated the calculations using p flat = 0.95 finding a perfect agreement of the reconstructed S N (E), see Fig. 11 . The same sensitivity analysis was performed for the bin size \u03b4E dictating the discretisation of the mapping norms: while in all simulations we employed \u03b4E = 0.2, by repeating the calculations for N = 856 with a bin width of \u03b4E = 0.5 we again observed excellent agreement of the results, see Fig. 11 .

For each N , we report results obtained via (i) Wang-Landau sampling (\"WL\", red dotted lines), shifting the data so that the minimum of SN over the range of investigated norms is zero; (ii) a saddle-point approximation of the WL predictions (\"SP-approx\", orange dashed lines); and (iii) a random drawing of CG representations (\"Random\", black lines), in this latter case shifting the curve so that its maximum coincides with the one of the corresponding WL profile.

Specifically, Fig. 13 displays the heat capacity CV of the lattice gas, see Eq. 53 in the main text, as a function of the inverse temperature \u03b2 for different degrees of CG'ing N , calculated from the Legendre-Fenchel transform \u03b2FN (\u03b2) of the WL entropies SN (E), see Eq. 52. While for the highest degree of CG'ing investigated, N = 1438, the heat capacity has a smooth dependence on \u03b2, for N = 1284 CV develops a sharp peak for low temperatures, which suggests the presence of a solid-liquid transition in the system. By further decreasing the degree of CG'ing, this solid-liquid peak gets initially flanked by a shoulder located at higher temperatures, and finally disappears. The shoulder, on the other hand, grows in magnitude as fewer and fewer sites are retained, and becomes a discontinuity for N = 214, suggesting the appearance of a liquid-gas transition.",
