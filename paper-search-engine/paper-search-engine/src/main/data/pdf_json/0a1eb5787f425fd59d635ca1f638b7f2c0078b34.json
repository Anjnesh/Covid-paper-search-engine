[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Mathematical models are known to help determine potential intervention strategies by providing an approximate idea of the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. [7] [8] [9] [10] To predict the course of epidemics, various complex mathematical concepts and models have been developed, including the following: the epidemic exponential growth rate (mainly the susceptible-infectious-recovered [SIR] model) [11] [12] [13] , susceptible-exposed-infectiousrecovered (SEIR) model 12, [14] [15] [16] [17] , exponential growth rate and basic reproduction number (parametric approach, nonparametric approach), the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model 18 , least squares estimation, maximum likelihood estimation, and mechanistic and phenomenological models. 19 However, working with these models is the purview of highly specialized professionals. To estimate the pandemic growth rate, an adequate mix of medical and advanced mathematical knowledge is required. To develop proper responses, not only are more accurate disease spread models needed, but also those that are easy to use. 13, 20 Few studies have been published in search for a straightforward mathematical model that can be easily used by clinicians to forecast the approximate rate of COVID-19 spread, and unfortunately, none of these few models published are as simple as expected. 18, 20, 21 Therefore, it may be useful for clinicians and healthcare managers working daily in hospitals to have access to fundamental formulas that can easily predict the course of the epidemic based on its current state of evolution.",

The logistic function curve fits well with the pace of the pandemic over time, both with an early exponential rise and an eventual flattening as the population gains herd immunity. 13, [23] [24] [25] (Figure 1 ) Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Verhulst (1804-1849), a Belgian mathematician, studied the law of population growth and showed that its curve increases with a convex curvature and then continues to increase towards a limit but with a concave curvature. 23, 25, 26 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Over time, a stable population will reach a saturation level, which is the limit, and the total number of events will not increase higher than this limit. 12 Verhulst-Pearl's exponential growth model has formed the basis for other models. Using this formula simply, if the population of a country and the cumulative number of infected cases in two subsequent time units (t0 and t1) in the given country are known, it is possible to estimate the cumulative number of cases at future time points (t2, t3, t4, and so on).",

The motivation behind using Wikipedia as a source for this information was that those pages are updated with the latest data on the countries' populations. We also recorded the world's total population for a comparison. The total number of COVID-19 cases and the total number for these 20 countries and for the world were obtained from the WHO situation report dated July 1, 2010, and recorded as time t = 0. Similarly, we found the total numbers of COVID-19 cases from the WHO status report dated July 8, 2020 28 , a week later, and recorded them as time t = 1. Then, using the Verhulst-Pearl logistic function formula, we calculated the total case estimates for each country and the world for July 15, July 22, and July 29, 2020 and recorded them as times t = 2, t = 3, and t = 4, respectively. We then compared our estimates with the numbers from the relevant dates of the WHO status reports on July 15, July 22, and July 29, 2020 [29] [30] [31] . We divided our estimation numbers by actual numbers and examined how much they deviated from the number 1. Finally, the formula was tested for longer-term reliability at t =18 and t = 40 weeks.",

Therefore, we were unable to make comparisons with other studies in the literature in the longer term, although our study covers a 10-month period. However, for the short term, the model we used provided estimation results that were similar to those of the dynamic stochastic complex models. Three methods, the mathematical models will not necessarily be accurate for long-term estimates, and therefore, the model parameters should be updated to provide reliable long-term forecasts. 22 This can be explained by the S-shape of the logistic function curve, which is convex in the early stages of a pandemic unlike the concave curvature seen in the later periods. In other words, when the curve approaches the limit (the saturation of transmission), the change over time will be less. Some published research suggests that mathematical models provide more accurate results at the early exponential growth stage of outbreaks, perhaps because any precautions have not yet been taken. 13 Since we have been interested in the long-term course of the pandemic leading to a potential herd immunity rather than the very short-term course, we used \"week\" instead of \"day\" for the time t-value in the formula, although we were aware that mathematical models were more accurate for short term daily forecasts and weekly forecasts are more prone to error as Arora et al noted. 39 To get an idea of whether the simple model we used in this study is as reliable as the complex models, we compared it with two published studies, one using the Susceptible, Infected and Recovered (SIR) model 40 and the other using recurrent neural networks, and long short-term memory (LSTM) based model 39 .",

[42] [43] [44] One of the methods to estimate the reproduction number is to use the growth rate of the cumulative incidence of cases during the exponential growth phase of the pandemic. 44 As can be expected, an exponential growth model estimates parameters more precisely during a pandemic's exponential growth phase. 45 All mathematical models are a simplifications of reality. 46 However, when these simplifications have little effect on the characteristics of the epidemic of interest, it can lead to a satisfactory result. Therefore, the Verhulst-Pearl equation is valid and useful in solving a simple optimal growth problem. 25, 26, 47 Of course, it is not flawless; the Verhulst model is a deterministic model (not a process wherein the random variable exists) and does not include any stochastic (randomly determined) components. Stochastic effects make the invasion threshold challenging to discern. 48 For example, the number of individuals susceptible to infection J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and the reproduction number decreases as the outbreak progresses. 49 The fluctuations on the level of the limit (in other words, endemic disease die-outs or the population saturation point or carrying capacity, similar to that of the increase of a country's population, is not unlimited in terms of herd immunity) cannot be explained by the Verhulst-Pearl model. 50 However, while adding more complexity to a mathematical model increases the realism, it often makes analysis difficult for an ordinary clinician, and more parameters increase the uncertainty.",

For herd immunity in the community, typically 60-90% of the population must be immunized via infection or vaccination. 51, 52 This percentage is called the herd immunity threshold. The basic reproduction number (R0) is the most important parameter in calculating the herd immunity threshold and refers to the average number of infected people caused by a single infectious person. 53, 54 Although it is not yet known what this rate is for COVID-19, it is estimated to be between 50-83%; deducted from that, the R0 value has been reported to be between 2 and 6 in COVID-19. 51, 52, 54, 55 . This means that when 50-83% of the population becomes immune to the COVID-19 disease, herd immunity will be theoretically achieved (calculated from the formula: herd immunity threshold R=1-1/R0). 53, 54, 56 . Hence, assuming there are no reinfections in COVID-19 disease and a lifelong immunity is obtained, and the R0 value is an average of 4 (i.e., 75% of the population must be infected for herd immunity), we found that 75% (approximately 5.8 billion) of the world population will be infected and immunized 64 weeks (1.10.2021) after t0 time (1.7.2020) in our study, and thus, herd immunity will be reached. This finding supports claims that herd immunity against COVID-19 cannot be achieved without unacceptably high case fatality rates, even if we assume that the death rate is 2%. 52 If the immunity gained by ongoing vaccination is considered, it may be possible to achieve herd immunity earlier. These estimates are for the whole world and, because there is heterogeneity in transmission, much better scenarios can be expected for an individual country based on the individual transmission dynamics including their specific R0 value and mortality rate, which are themselves dependent on many other factors, including age, genetic factors, socioeconomic factors, healthcare system, behavioral factors, use of personal protective equipment, and the spatial distribution of people. 53 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

With the COVID-19 pandemic, the herd immunity threshold seems highly unlikely due to factors such as the emergence of new variants, vaccine hesitancy, limited use of vaccines for children, and uncertainty about the extent to which vaccinated people are infected and spread the virus. 57 In the model used in our study, it was assumed that each individual could have only one COVID-19 infection, regardless of age, gender, or any other variable. In reality, we now know that it is possible to become infected more than once with COVID-19 and even that the virus might have a potential to reactivate after a latent period 58 , but we also know that this is not a very common situation, at least not during our study period. Therefore, we think that the herd immunity assumption may not have affected our study's overall results too much.",

Therefore, these models' results still might contain much uncertainty. However, the Verhulst-Pearl exponential growth model is deterministic, i.e., if the state of the system at a certain point in time is known, all future states can be determined by solving the relevant model. 59 Thus, when a rapid investigation is required, analysis using the Verhulst-Pearl exponential growth model, without taking potential stochastic effects into account, may be an option that provides initial results and an idea of the general sequence of events. 57, 60 . Therefore, large populations in stable environments often are modelled with deterministic models, while stochastic models are more useful in demonstrating the system's inherent variability for small population sizes. 59, 60 Thinking in deterministic terms is a way of generating concepts and trying to determine the most probable course of events, even if it excludes stochastic dynamics from the model. 60 Where pandemic led to a rationing of neurosurgical care in 80% of the responding countries. 3 While the study demonstrated a correlation between the resources available before the pandemic and the ability to uphold neurosurgical services, it also highlighted the collateral damage that prioritization and rationing may have on the population served by the neurosurgical centers participating in the survey. When forced to ration resources due to a pandemic event, an accurate estimation of its evolution would be extremely useful.",

Several other authors also reported using the Verhulst-Pearl logistic function in predicting cumulative case numbers from the COVID-19 pandemic. 13,34-36 Mahanty et al 36 compared two nonlinear growth models (Verhulst and Gompertz) and the susceptible-infectious-recovered model (SIR)to predict active COVID-19 cases in India, Pakistan, Italy, Germany, Brazil, and Myanmar, and found that the Verhulst model's fitting effect is better than that of the Gompertz and SIR models. Niazkar et al 37 used the three mathematical prediction models (a recursive-based method, the Boltzmann function-based model, and Beesham's prediction model) to forecast COVID-19 case and death numbers in Iran and Turkey. They concluded that these models failed to predict the first 10 to 20 days of data, although the recursive-based method was more effective than the others.
