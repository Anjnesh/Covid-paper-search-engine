During the Level 2.5 period, policies 187 much stronger than those from the Level 1 period were enabled, with all activities involving 188 the prohibition of indoor gatherings of more than 50 people, and the restriction of all private 189 facilities, including restaurants and cafes, to operation only between the hours of 05:00-21. 1 shows the monthly mean CO2 concentrations at the three observation sites from July 194 2019 to the present. Months with more than 50% of data missing owing to sensor calibration 195 were excluded. Although, on average, the CO2 concentration for all three observation sites is observation site. The mean CO2 concentration in YSB during this period is 442.99 ppm, which 199 is 11.00 and 13.34 ppm higher than that of NST (432.00 ppm) and GWA (429.65 ppm),200 respectively. In general, the three observation sites well represent variations in urban and local 201 background CO2 concentrations in downtown Seoul. In addition, the average CO2 202 concentration over the three stations (e.g., 434.88 ppm) is higher than that from Mauna Loa by 203 22.23 ppm obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 204 (https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html; Thoning et al., 1989). 205 Using the observed CO2 concentration data, urban enhancement in Seoul was quantified 206 in two ways. Fig. 2a shows a box plot of \u25b3CO2 1 for each period quantified using method 1, 207 which considers the difference in vertical CO2 concentration. The average \u25b3CO2 1 during the 208 pre-COVID-19 period is 22.56 ppm but decreases to 14.23 ppm during the Level 1 period and 209 10.99 ppm during the Level 2.5 period (Table 2). The 95 th percentile of \u25b3CO2 1 , a proxy for 210 high CO2 concentration emissions in Seoul, decreased more significantly from 59.04 ppm 211 during the pre-COVID-19 period to 40.94 and 36.15 ppm during Level 1 and Level 2.5 periods, 212 respectively. We calculated the urban contribution for each period (urban contribution = \u25b3CO2 213 / CO2 concentration \u00d7 100; Fig. 2b) to compare the percentage of \u25b3CO2 1 accounting for 214 atmospheric CO2 concentrations in Seoul. The degree to which the CO2 concentration due to 215 urban emissions affected the atmospheric CO2 concentration for each period was 4.81%, on 216 average, during the pre-COVID-19 period but decreased to 3.07% and 2.46% during the Level 217 1 and Level 2.5 periods, respectively. Compared with the pre-COVID-19 period, Seoul's urban 218 contribution was reduced by half, and Seoul's CO2 concentration showed a decreasing tendency 219 from 451.76 ppm during the pre-COVID-19 period to 451.38 and 434.54 ppm during the Level 220 1 and Level 2.5 periods, respectively. In contrast, background CO2 concentration increased although the urban CO2 concentration of Seoul reduced due to rapid decrease in CO2 emissions 267 caused by the social distancing policies. In other words, CO2 concentration in cities that are 268 known to generate most of the world's CO2 emissions can be effectively reduced by policies 269 that curb human activity (Duren and Miller, 2012; Schwandner et al., 2017). In addition, \u25b3CO2 270 and the urban contribution of Seoul over the Level 2.5 period showed a greater reduction than 271 that of the Level 1 period. Since Level 2.5 was implemented for only two weeks, the reduction 272 in CO2 concentration would have been more noticeable if the implementation period was longer. 273 This indicates that the intensity of the policies implemented within the city can greatly affect 274 the reduction in CO2 emissions. 275 The reduction of atmospheric CO2 concentration in urban areas can be considered a 276 compound result of changes in local weather conditions and direct emission from the city 277 (Xueref-Remy, 2018; Park et al., 2020a). Therefore, we analyzed the correlation between urban 278 CO2 enhancement and meteorological parameters (i.e., temperature, precipitation, wind 279 direction, and wind speed) during the research period to examine the impact of meteorological 280parameters on urban CO2 enhancement. We found that there was no statistically significant 281 correlation between urban CO2 enhancement and temperature and precipitation. In addition, 282 the urban CO2 enhancement did not significantly vary with the direction of the wind at the YSB 283 site. In contrast, CO2 enhancement showed a distinct exponential relationship with wind speed; 284 however, the average wind speed in Seoul was not significantly different during the pre-285 COVID-19, Level 1, and Level 2.5 periods. This demonstrates that the decrease in atmospheric 286 CO2 concentration in Seoul during the COVID-19 pandemic results from changes in direct CO2 287 emissions from Seoul due to social distancing policies.288The reduction in CO2 emissions due to COVID-19 social distancing policies was verified using traffic volume, which accounts for the largest portion of the emission sources in Seoul290 and floating population, presumed to represent human activity (Seoul Metropolitan 291 Government, 2017). The results show that the traffic volume and floating population around 292 the YSB site decreased by 10.73% and 12.55% during the Level 1 period and by 43.25% and 293 14.11% during the Level 2.5 period, respectively. Along with the traffic volume, fossil fuel 294 usage from buildings is the second largest source of direct CO2 emissions in Seoul; however, 295",
