            "text": "Organizations increasingly introduce collaborative technologies in form of virtual assistants (VAs) to save valuable resources, especially when employees are assisted with work-related tasks. However, the effect of VAs on virtual teams and collaboration remains uncertain, particularly whether employees show social loafing (SL) tendencies, i.e., applying less effort for collective tasks compared to working alone. While extant research indicates that VAs collaboratively working in teams exert greater results, less is known about SL in virtual collaboration and how responsibility attribution alters. An online experiment with N = 102 was conducted in which participants were assisted by a VA in solving a task. The results indicate SL tendencies in virtual collaboration with VAs and that participants tend to cede responsibility to the VA. This study makes a first foray and extends the information systems (IS) literature by analyzing SL and responsibility attribution thus updates our knowledge on virtual collaboration with VAs.",

            "text": "In today's business world, technological advancements constantly reshape organizational efforts for remaining competitive (Cetindamar Kozanoglu & Abedin, 2020; N. Frick & Marx, 2021; Soto Setzke et al., 2021) , transforming digital workplaces in enterprises for exploiting relative advantages (Junglas et al., 2019; Majhi et al., 2021; Meske & Junglas, 2020) . This also implies employees and teams increasingly collaborate with and via technology (Changizi & Lanz, 2019; de Vreede & Briggs, 2005) . The collaboration with technologies enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), such as virtual assistants (VAs), shifts from simply using a tool for virtual collaboration with other employees to shaping a novel and independent virtual environment to collaborate with VAs Mirbabaie et al., 2020; Seeber, Waizenegger, et al. 2020a) . VAs are software dialog systems simulating the behavior of humans which can be addressed via voice-or text-based commands and respond to the users' input appropriately (Brachten et al., 2020; Mirbabaie et al., 2020 Mirbabaie et al., , 2021b . The application possibilities in organizations are manifold but VAs are foremost used as work facilitators (Brachten et al., 2020; Luger & Sellen, 2016; Mirbabaie et al., 2020) . VAs collaborate with employees to optimize internal processes (Norman, 2017) , generate additional revenue or cost savings (Quarteroni, 2018) , and increase customer satisfaction (Behera et al., 2021; Verhagen et al., 2014) , thus aim to establish substantial advantages over market competitors Yan et al., 2018) . Even though VAs do not provide a physical interaction and human representation (Maniscalco et al., 2020) , they are increasingly used in virtual collaboration (Panganiban et al., 2020; Seeber et al. 2020a) and their distribution in enterprises is likely to grow .",

            "text": "Many teams in organizations collaborate in virtual teams, which might even be globally distributed (Andres & Shipps, 2019; Hassell & Cotton, 2017; Massey et al., 2003; Plotnick et al., 2016) . Virtual collaboration happens through using simple tools such as Microsoft Teams or Slack (N. R. J. Frick, et al., 2021a Frick, et al., , 2021b Frick, et al., , 2021c and reaches to computer-generated virtual realities (Fromm et al., 2020; Litvinova et al., 2018) . Existing research takes the standpoint that employees and VAs collaboratively working in virtual teams exert greater results (Seeber, et al., 2020b; Waizenegger et al., 2020) . However, less research is concerned with potential downsides. As in virtual collaboration, working with members in physical teams should inspire individuals to maximize their potential and to work particularly hard (Harkins & Petty, 1982) . Nevertheless, research on teamwork also identified social loafing (SL), i.e., individuals working less for collective tasks than for individual tasks (Hardy & Latan\u00e9, 1988; Karau & Williams, 1993) . Employees might apply less effort to achieve a goal in a team compared to when working alone as the individual contribution is perceived as unnecessary and/or responsibility attribution is distributed among team members (Jassawalla et al., 2009; Karau & Williams, 1993; Latan\u00e9 et al., 1979) . In corporate contexts, a possible decrease in motivation is one of the biggest obstacles for teamwork (George, 1992) ; it is thus vital to minimize individual tendencies to loaf (Schippers, 2014) especially for maintaining cohesiveness of teams (Taylor et al., 1983) .",

However, individuals increasingly collaborate in virtual teams with VAs Mirbabaie et al., 2020; Seeber, et al., 2020a Seeber, et al., , 2020b Seeber, et al., , 2020c thus scholars need to adjust their understanding on the different aspects of collaborative settings . To gain a deeper understanding on virtual collaboration with VAs, knowledge from human-to-human collaboration research needs to be exploited (Demir et al., 2020) . As collaboration with VAs in organizations is likely to become commonplace, and VAs are increasingly perceived as human-like actors since they are being inherently anthropomorphic (Feine et al., 2019; Hussain et al., 2019; Pfeuffer et al., 2019; Porra et al., 2020) , there is an urgent demand for the information systems (IS) discipline to conduct further research on virtual collaboration to reveal differences and similarities to human teams (Mirbabaie et al., 2021a) . Associated consequences might significantly alter theoretical and practical viewpoints of how and for what purpose VAs are applied in virtual collaboration. Employees no longer identifying themselves with a decision made by a VA, not questioning or taking responsibility for it, which possibly means making poor or even wrong choices (Trocin et al., 2021) . This generates enormous risks for both enterprises (i.e., diminishing reputation or profitability) and individuals (i.e., feeling less valued and more stressed) (Chidambaram & Tung, 2005; Grimes et al., 2021) . Missing responsibility attribution in human-VA teams decisively thus impacts the way VAs are implemented and how they are being applied in organizations, restricting their deployment to certain industries, departments, teams and purposes. Moreno et al. (2001) clarified that there is generally a contradiction on positive (constructivist hypothesis) and negative (interference hypothesis) outcomes when collaborating with VAs. On the one hand, VAs assist employees in virtual collaboration, freeing them from unwanted duties and allowing them to focus on their key responsibilities (Brachten et al., 2020) . On the other hand, intensified collaboration with VAs might yield in employees becoming dependent and showing greater SL tendencies and missing responsibility attribution . To examine the role of VAs in virtual collaboration and related consequences regarding SL and responsibility attribution, our research is guided by the following questions:",

Researchers will find the novel insights fruitful in understanding what consequences are related to virtual collaboration with VAs assisting in workrelated tasks. Practitioners, such as managers and software developers, will be able to comprehend possible downsides for human-VA teams and which measures might be rewarding to cope and/or prevent negative outcomes.

Throughout decades of fundamental research, several terms evolved for systems behaving alike. Popular terms that are related to VAs and found in theory and practice are chatbots (Stieglitz et al., 2018) , digital assistants and conversational agents (Frick et al., , 2021c . Scholars examined VAs from different perspectives (e.g., Luger & Sellen, 2016; Saffarizadeh et al. 2017; Seeber et al., 2018) . Gnewuch et al. (2017) differentiated VAs in their primary mode of communication (how users interact with VAs) and their main purpose (whether a VA covers a narrow or broad task). Knote et al. (2019) characterized VAs by their design characteristics, for instance, adaptivity (how VAs learn and adjust to changing environments) and assistance domain (in which area VAs provide assistance). While research is lacking a consistent classification of VAs due to possible overlaps in their capabilities , multiple definitions emerged but somewhat limit the manifold functionalities of VAs. In this research we follow the interpretation of Mirbabaie et al. (2021b) who defined VAs as \"dialog systems simulating the behavior of humans via different modes of communication (e.g., written or spoken natural language, haptics, gestures, facial expressions, graphics), continuously learn and develop over time by analyzing and interpreting a given input combined with additional data sources for assisting with divergent tasks or execute them autonomously\" (p. 4). Figure 1 outlines two examples of VAs that were used in earlier studies (Brachten et al., 2020; Mirbabaie et al., 2020) .",

The development of VAs is based on AI and underlying machine learning (ML) algorithms attempting to create intelligent systems augmenting the abilities of humans (McTear, 2017) . However, there are certain distinctions of intelligent behavior . One the one hand, there are agents that respond to a certain input based on predefined rules (Russel & Norvig, 2016) . On the other hand, there are adaptive systems that behave reactively, proactively and autonomously (von Wolff et al., 2019) while continuously learning and developing over time by processing different types of digital information (Mitchell et al., 2018) . VAs aim to combine the complementary strengths of humans and AI (Kamar, 2016) , for example, associating emotional intelligence of humans with the processing of huge amounts of data (Dellermann, et al., 2019a (Dellermann, et al., , 2019b . Thereby, VAs supply humans with feedback to assist in decision-making (e.g., AI in the loop of human intelligence), and humans supply VAs with feedback to optimize their capabilities (e.g., human intelligence in the loop of AI) (Dellermann, et al., 2019a (Dellermann, et al., , 2019b Dellermann, et al., 2019a Dellermann, et al., , 2019b Mirbabaie et al., 2021b) .",

They adapt to users with varying roles by addressing them via different languages (Gnewuch et al., 2020; Pfeuffer et al., 2019) , interpret emotions of individual team members (McDuff & Czerwinski, 2018) and foster disclosing of relevant information (Frick et al., , 2021c . VAs (Brachten et al., 2020; Mirbabaie et al., 2020) are further inherently anthropomorphic since they use verbal, visual, auditory, and invisible social cues, for instance jokes, facial expression, laughing and response time, which makes users feel like talking to another human (Feine et al., 2019; Hussain et al., 2019; Pfeuffer et al., 2019) . Within the research stream of CASA (Computers Are Social Actors) it has been identified that individuals exhibit social reactions when collaborating with technology (Nass & Moon, 2000) . As explained by the Social Response Theory, individuals subconsciously associate social rules towards technology that uses human-like traits or behavior (Nass & Moon, 2000; Reeves & Nass, 1996) . Furthermore, individuals have certain expectations towards VAs that use human-like design characteristics which might not be in line with their actual capabilities or purpose (Luger & Sellen, 2016) . Nevertheless, yet existing limited conversational skills of VAs remind individuals that they are still collaborating with a machine, raising feelings of strangeness possibly leading to a discontinued usage (Diederich et al., 2020) . Furthermore, there are also certain challenges and dangers related to security and privacy heavily impacting trust in VAs (de Barcelos Silva et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020) . For example, the feeling of being surveilled or that data is misused or retrieved for dubious purposes decreases trust in the agent and hinders the distribution of information . Moreover, interacting with VAs increases the transparency of working methods, roles and tasks which causes discomfort (W\u00fcnderlich & Paluch, 2017) and yields in a feeling of being monitored, losing personal value and control as well individual knowledge .",

Male volunteers were asked to pull on a rope as hard as they can (tug-of-war) in groups of varying sizes where a measuring device determined the total effort. The results showed that as the group sizes increased, the group performance was increasingly lower than from the addition of individual performances. This behavior was later explained as SL, \"the reduction in motivation and effort when individuals work collectively compared with when they work individually\" (Karau & Williams, 1993, p. 681) . SL might arise when individuals perceive their contribution to be unnecessary and/or responsibility is distributed among members of a team (Karau & Williams, 1993; Latan\u00e9 et al., 1979) . SL is also expected to rise when team sizes increase as the responsibility is distributed among several humans (Dennis et al., 2005) . A decrease of SL is possible when individuals believe that they are being monitored and measured by their personal performance (Karau & Williams, 1993) . Thus, the individual contribution is reduced when members of nominal groups believe that they are collectively working in teams.",

For example, Smith et al. (2001) observed that a lower need for cognition is associated with SL. Individuals who enjoy and participate in elaborating cognitive tasks are less likely to reduce their efforts in groups. Schippers (2014) examined personality traits and indicated that a high occurrence of conscientiousness and agreeableness within a group might compensate SL tendencies. In contrast, a recent study of Hou et al. (2021) examined SL in online brand communities and revealed that agreeableness and conscientiousness do not have a direct impact on SL. Nevertheless, the authors explained that personality traits are indirectly related to SL behavior. Research further identified apathy and social disconnectedness as antecedents for SL and explained that participants took compensatory actions when members of their teams loaf (Jassawalla et al., 2009) . Individuals with low self-efficacy and self-confidence, who consider themselves more valuable than others, show SL tendencies (Hart et al., 2004) . Moreover, competency, emotional relationship, and collective identity were found to be key determinants of social loafing (Luo et al., 2021) .",

Although several scholars offered theories on SL, they are generally limited to explaining one of several possible causal mechanisms and do not attempt to include the wide range of variables (Karau & Williams, 1993) . The explanations provided by the researchers can usually be assigned to one of the following three main theories. Within the Social Impact Theory, a diffusion of responsibility leads to SL. Latan\u00e9 et al. (1979) explained that individuals feel deindividualized when the size of a group increases, distancing themselves from their own individual performance which decreases personal responsibility. Thus, when the number of team members increases, the feeling of pressure reduces as the burden is distributed among multiple individuals. The Free Rider Theory explains that team members recognize that completing a task is achievable without using their full potential and that the benefit of performing a task does not increase by hanging in (Albanese & van Fleet, 1985) . Finally, within the Theory of Social Comparison SL is caused as individuals consider outside reference points to assess their own effort, abilities, and skills. Thereby, individuals match their performance to that of their team members (Harkins & Szymanski, 1989) . When a team member perceives that others in the group are slacking or showing laziness, they are likely to reduce their own efforts (Jackson & Williams, 1985) .",

One the one hand, IS scholars applied SL theories in IT related contexts and assessed whether existing assumption are still valid (e.g., Dennis et al., 2005) . On the other hand, studies focused on possible negative outcomes when using IT and how SL might be decreased (e.g., Suleiman & Watson, 2008) . For example, an early study of Suleiman and Watson (2008) examined the diminishing of SL in technology-supported teams. The authors indicated that SL occurs in teams supported by technology and argued that further research is urgently needed as mixed virtual teams become more prevalent thus employees increasingly gain the opportunity to loaf. Alnuaimi et al. (2010) argued that, due to new possibilities in IT, teams no longer need to be tied to a specific location but can collaborate across national borders. The authors assigned 140 participants in 32 teams which had to solve a brainstorming task assisted by a group system software. The results revealed that the diffusion of responsibility, attribution of blame, and dehumanization meditates the effect of team size and dispersion of SL. Current research further found that the type of trust is important to understand how scrutiny changes the influence of trust on individual SL in virtual teams (Robert, 2020) . Thereby, Robert (2020) identified that cognitive trust negatively influences SL, while affective trust tends to strengthen SL. Furthermore, Lv et al. (2021) described that SL is related to decreased perceived justice and functional benefits which leads to negative wordof-mouth, switching behavior, and counterproductive work behavior.",

Another study of Fronza and Wang (2021) determined rules to prevent social loafing behavior in agile software development teams using a mixed-method approach which includes an action case study of software development teams and analyzing secondary data. The results indicate that the formulation of team expectations agreements, for instance, on meeting attendance and contribution, respect of tasks, roles and teammates, and collaboration, have the potential to prevent SL.",

Previous research has stated that VAs alter the way employees collaborate in organizations (Dias et al., 2019; Wang & Siau, 2018) explaining the pressing need for theory and practice to understand how employees collaborate with VAs within their virtual teams Seeber et al., 2018) . VAs are already perceived as legitimate team members (Seeber et al., 2018) and being inherently anthropomorphic where individuals feel like interacting with another human (Feine et al., 2019; Hussain et al., 2019; Pfeuffer et al., 2019) .

This decrease of social forces on individuals results in less participation. In terms of SL, this is referred to as diffusion of responsibility. Individuals feel deindividualized when the size of the group increases resulting in distancing themselves from their own individual performance decreasing personal responsibility (Latan\u00e9, 1981; Latan\u00e9 et al., 1979) . In virtual collaboration, employees might apply less effort to achieve a goal in a team compared to when working alone as the responsibility attribution is distributed among team members (Jassawalla et al., 2009; Karau & Williams, 1993; Latan\u00e9 et al., 1979) .

Individuals with a high level of conscientiousness and agreeableness are likely to maintain cooperation in group settings and preserve self-discipline (Liao & Chuang, 2004; Tangney et al., 2004) . When individuals in teams notice the reduced efforts of other team members, they tend to increase their own efforts to compensate the slacking of others and still achieve proper results (Williams & Karau, 1991) . Both personality traits have been investigated in the context of collaborative technology and their association with teamwork and task accomplishment (Devaraj et al., 2008; Mouakket & Sun, 2020; Soltani et al., 2013) . Earlier studies identified that conscientiousness and agreeableness negatively influence SL tendencies in human-human as well as in technology-supported teams (Bolin & Neuman, 2006; Hoon & Tan, 2008; Morgeson et al., 2005; Schippers, 2014) . A recent study of Hou et al. (2021) revealed that agreeableness and conscientiousness do not have a direct impact on SL in online brand communities. Nevertheless, personality traits indirectly impact SL behavior due to a high level of social distances in technological surroundings resulting in dehumanization (Hou et al., 2021) . The mere question of whether SL occurs in virtual collaboration with VAs cannot be answered solely. Personality traits are repeatedly mentioned as relevant aspects in extant literature (e.g., Hoon & Tan, 2008; Schippers, 2014) , however, the impact on SL in virtual teams remains indistinct (Byun et al., 2020) . We thus aim to identify parallels of human teams and claim that conscientiousness and agreeableness of individuals in teams lowers SL tendencies when collaborating with a VA.

Current studies also indicated that individuals might no longer identify themselves with a certain task and cognitive skills might become superfluous . To consider these aspects in the context of our study, we assess how participants rate their individual knowledge regarding the task they are being assisted with.

The participants were recruited using SurveyCircle enabling researchers to identify suitable subjects while guaranteeing a diversified sample (SurveyCircle, 2021). The platform allows students and researchers in the German-speaking countries to collect points by participating in studies, which, in turn, can be passed on to participants in own studies. SurveyCircle further ensures that surveys are carried out correctly, for example, subjects who fall significantly short in the processing time are penalized or even banned. Participants are thus more likely to provide complete answers instead of performing the study hastily or incorrectly. Nevertheless, we screened the data manually for anomalies and suspicious responses (i.e., very short processing times and similar or identical answers) but did not need to exclude any participants. In terms of sample size, Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2005) advise to include at least 64 participants for Karau and Williams (1993) and Nass and Moon (2000) H2: There is a positive correlation between SL tendencies in virtual collaboration with VAs and responsibility attribution to the VAs Latan\u00e9 (1981) and Latan\u00e9 et al.

Most of the respondents already had a university degree (60.8%) or the highest school-leaving qualification (38.2%). The vast majority (81.4%) indicated that they were still studying, while the minority were already employed (18.6%). Since the study is intended to only consider individuals who have already worked professionally, individuals who indicated that they were still studying were also asked to state whether they were part-time employed. Participants who did not fulfil this requirement were not included in the analysis. Students are generally considered suitable subjects as, compared to experienced professionals, they may tend to be less biased due to less work experience (Brachten et al., 2020) . Additionally, they might have less issues operating VAs than an average adult since younger individuals are more affine to modern communication technology (Brachten et al., 2020) .",

The platform allows the development of VAs without extensive programming knowledge and includes several features such to provide natural and rich conversational interfaces (Canonico & De Russis, 2018) . VAs developed using Dialogflow can be integrated in various applications or simply as iframe on websites. We embedded the VA into LimeSurvey's online platform so that subjects were able to interact using a question-answer component (Lamontagne et al., 2014; Morrissey & Kirakowski, 2013) without switching applications. We used a text-based interface to maintain a simplified interaction with the VA (Araujo, 2018) and avoid overwhelming participants with multiple input possibilities. The VA was designed to be simple rather than sophisticated, as the development of a highly complex VA using numerous social cues would have been beyond the scope of this research. Thereby, the VA simulates intelligent behavior by selecting a prefabricated answer based on distinct keywords used in the participant's input (detailed examples on prefabricated answers according to corresponding keywords can be found in the \"Appendix\"). Initially, the VA welcomes participants and explains its functionalities. Since a VA should also be able to participate in social discussions (Brachten et al., 2020; Feine et al., 2019) , it is able to participate in a whole range of different small talk topics, i.e., the question of mood and feeling.",

The tasks were chosen to be challenging but not too difficult as SL is more likely to occur when tasks are perceived as simple, and the invested effort is not measured (Karau & Williams, 1993; Latan\u00e9 et al., 1979) . As we were not interested in how fast the tasks were solved but whether SL and ceding attribution was observable, the actual outcome of each task did not have any effect on our analysis.

Participants were asked to apply the critical path method to arrange certain activities according to their dependencies for calculating an overall duration. Thereby, a VA provided subjects with guidance on solving the task. In our classification task, participants were asked to read car reviews and rate whether they were a recommendation to buy. Accordingly, a VA was able to assist in evaluating the reviews. The verdict is not actually based on an intelligent analysis of the VA but on the assessments of a real person who was not involved in the intention of the study at the time of the evaluation. It should be noted that the VA's assessment was not always correct but corresponded to the authentic assessment of the real person. The responses also varied in terms of certainty, the VA might have given confident and definite or uncertain and insecure estimates. In addition, the VA was able to provide answers to detailed questions, for instance, reassuring to stick with a decision even if the review contained opposing or deviating information.",

We narrowed down our validated 8 questions to 6 items achieving a satisfying reliability with Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.77.

It is reasonable to query general SL tendencies as well as SL tendencies in the task via self-rating, since Conway and Lance (2010) state that correlations collected between different test methods tend to be weaker and less accurate. Karau and Williams (1993) suggested that selfratings of SL affect self-reported effect sizes when a cover story was used to inform participants that the study was about effort versus performance or when maximizing rather than optimizing tasks were used (Schippers, 2014) .

The Big Five is a model of personality psychology consisting of five main dimensions: openness to experience (open-mindedness), conscientiousness (perfectionism), extraversion (sociability), agreeableness (consideration, cooperativeness, empathy), and neuroticism (emotional lability and vulnerability). The Big Five have been substantiated by many studies and is internationally regarded as the universal standard model in personality research (John et al., 2008) . Agreeableness and conscientiousness were each measured with twelve items using a five-point Likert scale (disagrees completely to fully agree). Example items for agreeableness are \"I am interested in people\" and \"I make people feel at ease\". Conscientiousness included, for instance, \"I am always prepared\" and \"I often forget to put things back in their proper place\". The items proved a high reliability in our study both for agreeableness (\u03b1 = 0.79) and conscientiousness (\u03b1 = 0.85). Cacioppo et al. (1984) originally developed a standardized questionnaire comprising 45 items to assess need for cognition which were further shortened by several researchers (e.g., Bless et al., 1994) . We used the short version of the need for cognition scale consisting of four items (Bei\u00dfert et al., 2014) : \"I would prefer more complicated problems to simple problems\", \"First and foremost I think because I have to\", \"It is enough for me simply to know the answer without understanding the reasons for answering a problem\" and \"I like my life to be full of tricky tasks that I have to solve.

Although analyzing cognitive load in virtual collaboration with a VA was not the main objective of this study, it provides profound indications whether participants are relieved when collaboration with a VA. The NASA-TLX scale was developed by the American national Aeronautics and Space Administration (Hart & Staveland, 1988) and determines the perceived workload of a task (Galy et al., 2012) . It has successfully been applied in several experimental settings (Cao et al., 2009; Noyes & Bruneau, 2007; Rubio et al., 2004) and even in the context of VAs (Brachten et al., 2020; Mirbabaie et al., 2020) achieving high reliability (\u03b1 = 0.89). The scale includes six subscales (1) mental demands, (2) physical demands, (3) time demands, (4) performance, (5) effort and (6) frustration, and were measured on a five-point Likert scale (very low to very high). Mental demand assesses cognitive efforts and physical demands manual efforts. Temporal demand determines the perceived time pressure when executing a task. Performance captures the individual perception of accomplishment. Effort estimates the expense which had to be undertaken to reach a result, and frustration explains the level of saddening when solving a task. In this study, the subscale reached a medium reliability (\u03b1 = 0.71).",

The participants were requested to read various test reports on different car models and needed to judge whether they recommend purchasing a specific car or not. Therefore, the evaluation was rated on a six-point scale (1 = very good; 2 = good; 3 = satisfactory; 4 = sufficient; 5 = poor; 6 = insufficient). However, participants were told that they were not alone in completing the task but assisted by a VA. Before rating the cars, we explained how to interact with the VA, that the communication is like talking to a human-being and that the VA achieves equal results compared to a real individual. Furthermore, subjects were able perform an exemplary interaction to become familiar with the VA. After the participants confirmed that they had understood how to interact with the VA, they needed to perform the actual task. We outlined the brand, name, and model of the cars as well as the text-based reports and asked whether they recommend buying the car or not. In total, the participants needed to provide five recommendations assisted by the VA. After the task, we collected information on general SL tendencies, SL in virtual collaboration with the VA, attribution of responsibility, personality traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness and need for cognition), and finally cognitive load. The online experiment concluded with a debriefing including an explanation of the purpose of this study. The major steps of our experiment are visualized in Fig. 3 .",

We used the Pearson correlation coefficient as reliable and widely accepted statistical metric allowing scholars to measure the strength of a linear relationship between two variables with normally distributed data (Schober et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2016) . Table 3 summarizes the Pearson correlations of the specific constructs (Field, 2013) . The analyses were calculated using SPSS Statistics (Version 25). In order to examine the extent to which a positive relationship between general SL tendencies and SL in collaboration with a VA can be observed, a correlation was calculated between the general SL scale and the scale for SL in collaboration with a VA. According to Field (2013) a Pearson correlation is the most suitable way to investigate a relationship between two metric variables. The calculation showed a moderately strong positive correlation (r = 0.344, p < 0.001) (Cohen et al., 1955) . The effect was calculated using a linear regression to draw conclusions about a deterministic relationship (Field, 2013) , which was significant with F(1, 100) = 13.381, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.118. This confirmed hypothesis H1, that there is a positive correlation between general SL tendencies and SL in virtual collaboration with VAs. Furthermore, the calculation of the correlation between the two variables (Field, 2013) of SL tendencies in virtual collaboration with VAs and responsibility attribution to the VAs indicated a significantly strong positive relationship (r = 0.710, p < 0.001) (Cohen et al., 1955) , confirming H2.",

The first key finding of this paper is that SL tendencies are not limited to physical and virtual collaboration with other humans, but also detectable in virtual collaboration with VAs (H1). The results revealed that individuals who show general SL tendencies also tend to reduce their efforts when collaborating with a VA (as measured adapted from Schippers, 2014) . Participants do not seem to be indifferent towards the task and hence show less efforts as completing the study would have been possible without reading and evaluating the test reports and even without collaborating with the VA. Instead, participants strive to complete the task in a reasonable manner but seem to rely on the VA as indicated by the average interaction time of 61.60 s with 5.85 queries per car. However, since a successful execution is possible without exploiting the own full potential (Albanese & van Fleet, 1985) , this corresponds to the actual understanding of the phenomenon SL (Kravitz & Martin, 1986) as also examined in early research on human group settings (e.g., Albanese & van Fleet, 1985; Latan\u00e9 et al., 1979; Williams & Karau, 1991) . Thus, similar to the collaboration in physical and virtual teams consisting out of human actors, individuals collaborating virtually with VAs are likely to avail the opportunity to loaf and might show less effort compared to working alone (Karau & Williams, 1993; Latan\u00e9 et al., 1979) . This may be explained by that fact that VAs are increasingly perceived as legitimate and equal team members to human colleagues (Seeber et al., 2018) . This result goes in line with earlier research explaining that VAs are becoming more human-like (Feine et al., 2019; Hussain et al., 2019; Pfeuffer et al., 2019; Porra et al., 2020) and that the unique capabilities of humans are increasingly difficult to differentiate from VAs' characteristics (Cha et al., 2020) . This raises several questions for IS scholars: In which tasks jointly solved in virtual teams does social loafing occur? How should VAs need to be designed in order to avoid or diminish SL tendencies in virtual collaboration? What effect is SL causing on the team spirit of virtual teams?",

            "text": "The second key finding of this study is that the responsibility of solving a task in virtual collaboration is likely to be attributed to the VA (H2). Thus, responsibility in virtual collaboration seems to be distributed regardless of whether collaborators are human or VAs. In our experiment, individuals might have been distancing themselves from their own individual performance or have perceived their contribution to be unnecessary since the VA might have been observed as collaborator capable of solving the task almost alone (Karau & Williams, 1993; Latan\u00e9 et al., 1979) . The level of interaction with the VA (61.60 s with 5.85 queries per car on average) further indicates that the participants value the VA's evaluation of the test reports. Our results have also shown that SL correlates negatively with cognitive load (H5). These results must be interpreted from an interference as well as constructivist perspective (Moreno et al., 2001) . From an interference perspective, we first interpret this to the mean that members of a virtual team might fail to identify with overall team outcomes and joint accomplishments. However, this could lead to virtual teams failing in gaining a mutual understanding on shared objectives and deteriorate spirit and cohesiveness of teams (George, 1992; Taylor et al., 1983) . Mirbabaie et al. (2021b) argued that this might result in \"employees no longer identifying themselves with a decision and not questioning or taking responsibility for it\" (p. 11) and further explain that essential information might be forgotten, and cognitive skills become expendable. Interpreting the findings from a constructivist standpoint explains that VAs in virtual collaboration are able to assist in the execution of tasks which might lead to more efficient and effective results (Seeber, et al., 2020a (Seeber, et al., , 2020b (Seeber, et al., , 2020c Waizenegger et al., 2020) . This has already confirmed by existing research (i.e., Brachten et al., 2020; Moreno et al., 2001) who demonstrated that individuals collaborating with VAs in virtual teams outperform humans in solving a task. Furthermore, Mirbabaie et al. (2020) argued that the support provided by a VA is equal to that of a human being. Interpreting this within the context of SL, VAs in virtual teams are perceived as equal and human-like actors and findings of existing research on human teams are apparently transferable to virtual collaboration with VAs .",

However, this is contrary to Schippers (2014) who showed that conscientiousness and agreeableness impact SL tendencies in teams. Furthermore, Smith et al. (2001) indicated that individuals who are likely to enjoy elaborating cognitive tasks do not tend to reduce efforts in group tasks. Since our online experiment was constructed that individuals were supported by a VA exclusively and not by other team members, there might not have been any correlation with personality traits comparable to convenient teamwork and participants did not need to compensate the slacking of others (Williams & Karau, 1991) . In addition, our results uncovered a negative correlation between knowledge about the performed task and SL tendencies in virtual collaboration with VA (H6). This might even increase the effect as individuals, who do not perceive the task as challenging, show SL tendencies (Karau & Williams, 1993) . Thus, individuals are less likely to compensate the slacking of others since the task is perceived as very basic and/or less important.",

Research on SL is not only applicable to physical teams, virtual teams, or technology-supported teams (Karau & Williams, 1993; Robert, 2020; Suleiman & Watson, 2008) , but also to virtual collaboration with VAs. In theory and practice there is rather a negative attitude towards SL especially since there is a strong connection to ceding responsibility (e.g., Dennis et al., 2005; Suleiman & Watson, 2008) . Transferring these negative aspects on virtual collaboration with VAs, this might lead to not recognizing errors or mistakes of VAs, the quality of the work results deteriorates, and less cognitive load decreases team performance . However, SL in virtual collaboration with VAs somewhat differs from traditional SL. In contrast to human teams, by reducing the individual effort, no other human team member needs to compensate emerging slacking behavior. The lower effort is compensated by the VA possibly explaining the missing correlation between SL and personality traits in our study. Furthermore, lower cognitive load and the presence of SL in virtual collaboration with VAs indicates the main purpose of VAs: relieving individuals and assisting in the execution of tasks (Brachten et al., 2020; Mirbabaie et al., 2020; Norman, 2017; Seeber, et al., 2020a Seeber, et al., , 2020b Seeber, et al., , 2020c . Even though we motivated this study by elaborating that SL is unfavorable, responsibility attribution might even be a good thing since technologies enabled by AI outperform humans in certain domains, for instance, tackling repetitive tasks and interpreting complex interdependencies (Dellermann, et al., 2019a (Dellermann, et al., , 2019b Dellermann, et al., 2019a Dellermann, et al., , 2019b . We therefore derive, in the context of virtual collaboration with VAs in organizations, the term smart loafing and define \"the reduction of effort in human-VA collaboration to maintain cognitive resources and enhance efficiency in work\".",

            "text": "Smart loafing certainly possesses implications for organizations. Employees, and especially knowledge workers, tend to avoid repetitive tasks but rather seek a way to automate inconvenient procedures. Circumstances related to repetitive tasks or certain overhead negatively impact the workrelated wellbeing of individuals and, for instance, cause stress, lead to poor concentration or the feeling of exploitation (Pace et al., 2019) . Furthermore, executing tasks that are cognitively appealing or challenging convey a feeling of satisfaction and enhance the perception of one's unique value. Collaborating with VAs might even augment cognition, intelligence, and capabilities of individuals (Siddike et al., 2018) . Moreover, the reduction of effort in human-VA collaboration unleashes cognitive resources (Brachten et al., 2020) which, in turn, can be used for more meaningful purposes thus improve the overall organizational performance and revenue . Therefore, smart loafing in organizations comes handy if individuals' slacking does not outweigh advantages or yields in errors or faulty decisions. Nevertheless, VAs certainly possess the ability to recognize and prevent or counteract emerging negative behavior in virtual collaboration with humans. VAs might, for example, use certain social cues to avoid that humans blindly rely on certain outcomes while promoting collaborative decisionmaking and enhancing the accountability for tasks .",

            "text": "Since this study took a first foray into the identification of SL in virtual collaboration with VAs, we developed our experimental setting as well as the VA and the task quite simple. Participants were assisted by a VA in the execution of one task where the task itself was not jointly solved within a larger team. Furthermore, we used a text-based VA with a limited level of anthropomorphism. The interaction with a VA using voice commands and integrating certain social cues might change the perceived usefulness of the assistance and related effects (Edwards et al., 2019; Feine et al., 2019) . Further studies may develop more complex settings and survey participants in experimental surroundings. We further recommend extending our findings to more complex and cognitive challenging tasks to determine SL tendencies in mixed virtual teams with multiple humans and VAs. We also assess the investigation of the impact on the individual's cognitive load as highly relevant. On the upside, using VAs in virtual collaboration might free humans from unwanted duties and enables to focus on more relevant tasks (Brachten et al., 2020) . On the downside, individuals might blindly rely on results derived by VAs and not taking responsibility for tasks which might lead to inferior results . We also invite scholars to analyze social cues in virtual collaboration with VAs and how they relate to SL behavior. It might be appealing to adapt existing findings from management science and equip a VA with a specific set of social cues that are beneficial to enhance the intrinsic motivation of human collaborators and reduce SL tendencies (Khan et al., 2020) .",

Future research should analyze a diversified and larger sample as well as include certain control variables, for instance, the number of questions asked by individuals, to reveal yet unrecognized effects. In addition, the information provided by the participants are based on self-reported data. Karau and Williams (1993) suggested that self-ratings of SL affect self-reported effect sizes only when a cover story was used to inform participants that the study was about effort versus performance or when maximizing rather than optimizing tasks were used (Schippers, 2014) . Therefore, it would be interesting to identify differences from objective evidence. Especially data from experimental group settings seem to be fitting to shed additional light on the phenomenon SL in virtual collaboration with VAs. Moreover, questioning a participant about the given task that has been solved assisted by a VA could reveal the actual engagement in the task. Still, the results of this first foray offer empirical insights for gaining a deeper understanding on virtual collaboration with VAs and indicates that knowledge from human-to-human collaboration in terms of SL is transferable.",

Second, this study highlights that the responsibility of solving a task in virtual collaboration is likely to be attributed to a VA. Third, SL in virtual collaboration with VAs somewhat differs from traditional SL. It can be concluded that previous insights of teamwork are transferred to virtual teams and existing assumption are still valid (Dennis et al., 2005; Mirbabaie et al., 2020) . Furthermore, the increasing collaboration with VAs in virtual environments Seeber, et al., 2020a Seeber, et al., , 2020b Seeber, et al., , 2020c is blurring the boundaries between human-human and human-VA teams (Seeber et al., 2018) .

Welcome to our survey on \"Human Collaboration with Virtual Assistants \"! Virtual assistants can be considered as dialog systems assisting in the execution of work-related tasks or even have them fulfilled entirely. The purpose of this study is to gain insights into the collaboration between humans and virtual assistants when jointly completing a task together in a work context The study will take about 15-20 min of your time. By participating, you will make an important contribution for gaining new insights into the collaboration with virtual assistants Participation is voluntary, you can terminate the survey at any time. All data is stored and processed anonymously. It is at no time possible to draw conclusions about your person. There is no right and wrong in the answer Please read all questions thoroughly and answer honestly Thank you very much for your participation Explanation of the task Imagine you are an employee of a medium-sized company and you are entrusted with the task of determining the new company car fleet from the \"small car\" segment. In a first step, you have already obtained a large number of test reports and now need to evaluate which one is a recommendation for or against purchasing the car. For this purpose, you need to read the test reports and then click on \"Recommend to buy\" or \"Do not recommend to buy\" based on your evaluation. However, you are not alone with this task: A virtual assistant aids you with your evaluation. The virtual assistant has similar abilities compared to a human being and understands human language. You can therefore simply chat with it just as you would do with a real human. For example, write \"Hello\" to greet the assistant. By writing the name of the particular car model, the virtual assistant will give you its personal evaluation. You might also ask the assistant for its functionalities and how they work. After you have evaluated the test reports, you will be taken to the next page to answer some final questions Debriefing",

The Stuttgart-based company installs a multi-plate clutch on the rear axle that automatically engages the rear wheels when the front wheels are spinning. The advantage of this \"part-time\" all-wheel drive is that the A 220 4Matic is a front-wheel drive vehicle most of the time, which should reduce fuel consumption. However, this is only partially successful, as the consumption in the ADAC Ecotest clearly shows. 7.9 l/100 km is clearly too much for a compact car. At least the exhaust emissions are at a very low level, to which the installed particulate filter also contributes. The driving performance is also convincing. The two-liter turbo gasoline engine has an easy time with the 1.5-ton Swabian and, in conjunction with the crisp handling of the expertly tuned chassis, ensures that driving is a real pleasure. On the other hand, the new MBUX operating system, which is making its debut in the A-Class, deserves criticism. Although the range of functions and graphics are outstanding, operation via the touch surfaces on the steering wheel and center console requires a great deal of attention from the driver, and distraction is correspondingly high. Overall, the Mercedes A 220 4Matic is a compact that is packed with state-of-the-art technology, but the Stuttgart company has overshot the mark somewhat in terms of operation and fuel consumption Funding Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.",
