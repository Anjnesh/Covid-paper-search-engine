We have observed that each Covid variant produces this type of epidemic shape at a different moment, resulting in a multimodal epidemic shape. We will show in this document that each mode can still be estimated with models described in the two previous papers provides we replace the cumulated number of positive cases y by the cumulated number of positive cases reduced by a parameter P to be estimated. Therefore denoting z the logarithm of y \u2212 P , z follows approximately the differential equation\u017c = b \u2212 az r where a, b, r have also to be estimated from the observed data. We will show the obtained predictions on the four French",

In [2] we have shown that time-invariant SIR models [5, 4] were not effective to forecast the number of contaminated-detected people and we have proposed a new model. It was a dynamical linear model forecasting the logarithm of the cumulated infected-detected population z. In [2] The dynamics was\u017c = b \u2212 az. In [3] we have shown that this model could be improved using the dynamic\u1e61 z = b\u2212az r where r is a real number to be estimated from the observed data. These models are good for what we call an unimodal epidemic, which is a daily number of contaminated people with a bell shaped form. But it is clear now that the Covid epidemic is a succession of different epidemics coming from different variants and therefore the epidemic may be multimodal. We propose here a method to estimate the different modes. Remarking that each mode corresponds to the domination of one variant it is natural to think that the previous models applied not to y but to y \u2212 P is valid during the time period of domination of the considered variant. Then P has the interpretation of the cumulated positive cases number due to previous variants. The model being effective only during the period of domination of the considered variant. The difficulty is to estimate this parameter P . We will explain a way to estimate the four parameters a, b, r, P and will give the results obtained for the four French modes.",
