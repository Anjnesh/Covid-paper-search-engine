In this cohort of patients, the seroprevalence decreased with increasing age, tendency not observed in the serosurvey conducted in the city of Sao Paulo (seroprevalence randomly ranging from 15.8% to 22% across the age strata). 10 Possible explanations include a selection bias, because older people have higher COVID-19-associated mortality and the relationship between immunosenescence and lower vaccine immune responses. 16 ",

Twenty-seven patients had a second test after 59 (IQR 50-63) days, showing a median index of 2.6 arbitrary units (IQR 1.6-4.2). There were no differences in median IgG index comparing the first and second measurements (Supplementary Material 3) but, importantly, in nine patients (33%) the IgG index became below the positivity threshold, indicating the phenomena of seroreversion (the first Latin American analysis of the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 among kidney transplant recipients. This survey was conducted in S\u00e3o Paulo, one of the epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. The reported 8.2% seroprevalence islower than that observed in the general population, 17.9% in July 2020, and 26.2% in October 2020.10 The reasons behind the seroprevalence difference observed are not completely understood, involving, but not limited to, differences in the attack rate, lethality rate, antibody response, and adherence to non-pharmacological measures. The attack rate was higher among transplant recipients than that in general population reported by the municipality, 11 as illustrated inFigure 1. This may have been possibly due to an observation bias, since these individuals have broader access to SARS-CoV-2 testing, thanks to coordinated and sequential measures implemented by the transplant center since the beginning of the pandemic.12 Conversely, the COVID-19 lethality rate was 10-times higher among the kidney transplant recipients compared to the general population (30% vs. 4%) 11(Figure 1), potentially reducing the number of IgG+ recipients during the survey.Finally, pharmacological immunosuppression may impair the antibody response, such as what is observed for seroconversion after other viral diseases and vaccines.13 Some evidence suggests that certain blood groups would influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection (group A patients would be more susceptible, for example), for reasons related to the interaction between the virus and target cells, but not yet completely established.14 In the present analysis, however, this association was not observed. There was a clear association between household contact and seroprevalence, as already demonstrated in previous surveys in the general population.4,15 Since prolonged and unprotected household contact represents the greatest risk of spreading the disease,",

Moreover, it is not possible to infer about population-or person-level protective immunity, since the presence of antibodies does not imply these antibodies protect the person. Third, the absence of a plaque-reduction neutralization test for confirming the IgG ELISA positive results prevents any conclusion about quantitative information on antibody titers that inhibit viral infection. Finally, in an ongoing pandemic, a large proportion of persons will be recently infected and therefore will be negative by serologic testing. 21 In conclusion, in this cohort of kidney transplant recipients living in the S\u00e3o Paulo city, the the seroprevalence for IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 was lower than that of the general population and decreased with ageing. The main source of exposition was household contact and there was seroreversion in a considerable proportion of these patients in a short period of time suggesting the need prioritization of preventive strategies for these individuals.
