Here we address changes in dream features both during the first wave, when the Italian government imposed a total lockdown, and the second wave (autumn 2020), when a partial lockdown was effected. In April 2020 (total lockdown), 1,622 participants (M age = 34.1 \u00b1 13.6 years; 1171F) completed an online survey including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and a set of questions on dream features and their possible changes relative to the month preceding the lockdown (pre-total lockdown).",

Approximately half of the subjects reported increased or decreased dream frequency (30.5% and 21.8%), length (27.1% and 15.8%) and vividness (31.5% and 17.1%) during total lockdown as well as during partial lockdown (frequency: 30.3% and 13.5%; length: 23.3% and 12.6%; vividness: 31.6% and 24.1%). Dream affect became significantly more negative in total lockdown relative to pre-total lockdown and in partial lockdown relative to pre-partial lockdown (both p < .001). Both in total lockdown and partial lockdown, increased negative dream emotionality significantly predicted changes in dream frequency, length and vividness, and was significantly predicted, in turn, by worsened sleep quality. Our data confirm that dream features are significantly affected by major life changes such as those imposed by a pandemic. The fact that between lockdowns negative dream affect returned almost to baseline level suggests that dream emotionality is closely related to lifestyle and wake-time emotional changes. Also, our findings point to a modulating role of sleep quality on dream emotionality.",

Generally, the public reported decreased levels of psychological wellbeing, especially people with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, COVID-19 patients, and healthcare workers (Vindegaard & Benros, 2020) . Surveys administered early in the lockdowns suggested that an increased percentage of people in Italy were reporting high and very high levels of distress compared with European norms (Moccia et al., 2020) . Another study revealed similar findings, specifically relatively higher rates of: post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression symptoms, anxiety, perceived stress and adjustment disorder symptoms (Rossi et al., 2020) . Risk factors for higher levels of psychological distress included female gender, anxious or depressive temperaments, and discontinued working activity (Moccia et al., 2020; Rossi et al., 2020) .",

For mood, average scores were computed on a 0-4 scale, considering 0 as very positive mood, 1 as moderately positive mood, 2 as neutral mood, 3 as moderately negative mood, and 4 as very negative mood. For the other three variables, a 0-2 scale was used, with 0 as absence of fear/stress, 1 as presence of moderate fear/stress, 2 as presence of extreme fear/ stress. For all four variables, average scores were slightly higher in PL relative to TL (mood: 2.17 \u00b1 0.99 versus 1.48 \u00b1 1.32; general fear: 0.90 \u00b1 0.49 versus 0.82 \u00b1 0.55; fear of contagion: 1.29 \u00b1 0.53 versus 1.17 \u00b1 0.78; stress: 1.02 \u00b1 0.48 versus 0.95 \u00b1 0.57, respectively), indicating worsened mood and higher levels of fear and stress during PL.

Indeed, aside from its association with dream emotionality in both lockdowns (a finding that will be discussed later on), we found that worsened sleep quality significantly predicted decreases but not increases in dream frequency, length and vividness, at least in TL. This finding is in contrast to previous data supporting an association of poor sleep quality (especially frequent nocturnal awakenings) with increased dream recall frequency (Schredl, Sch\u00e4fer, Weber, & Heuser, 1998; van Wyk, Solms, & Lipinska, 2019) . However, the existence and direction of this relationship are not yet well established, as other studies have shown either none (Seong, Jung, Park, Choi, & Joo, 2017) or opposite associations (Brand et al., 2011; Pagel & Shocknesse, 2007) .",

Results from our regression analyses give hints to the main determinants of the negative emotional shifts that occurred during both lockdowns. The increase of negative dream emotionality was predicted, during the first lockdown, by stress, negative mood, female gender and worsening of sleep quality, in line with data from a few previous studies conducted during the first pandemic wave. Specifically, Schredl and Bulkeley (2020) and Barrett (2020) reported greater increases of dream negative affect in women. Also, the proportion of negative versus positive dream emotions was found to be significantly higher in females, poor sleepers, younger subjects, subjects with PTSD-related symptoms, depression and anxiety symptoms (Gorgoni et al., 2021) . Finally, Scarpelli et al., (2021) found associations of higher nightmare frequency with female gender, wake after sleep onset time, sleep problems, anxiety and depression, among other variables. Interestingly, we found that increased negative dream affect during the second lockdown was predicted, instead, only by the impoverishment of sleep quality and by stress, though the latter failed to reach significance. This finding appears in contrast with our results on the participants' general state of worry during the second lockdown. In fact, as hypothesized, the increase in the number of daily Covid-19 cases in autumn 2020 relative to the first pandemic wave was reflected in a general increase of scores in psychological measures (negative mood, fear and stress), which was coherent with the strikingly higher percentage of participants who reported knowing someone who was positive to at the follow-up survey. This higher psychological distress was also confirmed by our longitudinal analysis (on 214 participants)",

The lack of associations between dream emotionality and psychological variables in PL suggests that the negative emotional shift observed in dreams was unrelated to this worsening of waking emotionality. However, it must be acknowledged that the precise relationships between waking and dream emotionality are still not fully understood (Conte et al., 2020 , especially regarding the mechanisms through which positive and negative affects of the waking state influence the corresponding emotional dimensions of the dream. Indeed, recent data from our group (Conte et al., 2020 call into question the existence of a direct reflection of prevalent emotional valence of wake into that of the dream. Furthermore, the possibility should be considered that the quality of psychological distress differs between the two pandemic waves, with that experienced during the first wave being more acute and that characterizing the second wave being more chronic. This could, in turn, bear differential effects on sleep mentation. Anyhow, our findings confirm the important modulating role played by sleep quality in determining dream emotional valence (already highlighted in Conte et al., 2021) .",

Specifically, it predicted both increases and decreases of the other dream variables (though in two cases there was only a trend). This pattern suggests that the emotional valence of dreams could be a particularly relevant factor in determining several aspects of dream recall (both its frequency and the perceived characteristics of recalled dreams), possibly through a \"salience effect\". Indeed, the salience hypothesis of dream recall suggests that the subjective relevance of dream contents significantly affects their recall (Cohen & MacNeilage, 1974) . Therefore, it is plausible that, given a higher salience of negatively toned dreams, their other quantitative and qualitative aspects are influenced in different directions according to individual characteristics (for a review on individual differences affecting dream features, see Blagrove & Pace-Schott, 2010) . For instance, while negatively toned (i.e. more salient) dreams could be perceived as longer and more vivid by most subjects, they could be recalled as shorter and less vivid by others due to some sort of cognitive suppression mechanism. Also, state factors, such as pre-sleep mood, sleep fragmentation, interference upon awakening or physiological arousal during the dream could modulate this mechanism (Blagrove & Pace-Schott, 2010; Cohen, 1974) .",

The proportion was quite different from that reported by other studies conducted in the USA (8.15%; Schredl & Bulkeley, 2020) and Finland (55%; Pesonen et al., 2020) , while it was similar to that reported by another Italian study (20%; Iorio et al., 2020) , suggesting a role of cultural differences in modulating dream imagery and the incorporation of waking life events in dreams (incorporation continuity hypothesis; Schredl, 2012; Schredl & Hofmann, 2003) , although differences in data collection methods should also be taken into account. Also, Covid-19-related dream content was more probable in subjects showing a more pronounced shift to negative dream emotionality, in line with the findings of Schredl and Bulkeley, (2020) and, unsurprisingly, in women and in participants reporting higher general fear and increased dream vividness.",

First, participants self-selected and thus may have already had changes in their sleep and dreaming features that prompted their interest in completing the survey, thereby limiting generalizability of our data to the population at large. Second, retrospective assessments on the pre-lockdown periods may have resulted in recall bias. Additionally, assumptions about the impact of the crisis (as well as lifted restrictions) on sleep and dreaming may have led participants to overestimate the changes in their sleep and oneiric activity in the direction that would be expected based on confirmation bias. Despite these limitations, which are common to most dream studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, these findings provide chronological depth to the existing literature on dreaming and its sensitivity to daytime emotionality and lifestyle changes during a public health crisis.",

More importantly, to our knowledge, this is the first study to follow the evolution of these changes over the course of a pandemic, taking into account both the first, more acute phase, and related strong restrictions, and a second phase, characterized by lower restrictions in the face of prolonged stress. In this sense, our findings highlight that dream features are extremely sensible to lifestyle and wake-time emotional changes, in that their modifications closely followed the oscillations in the course of the pandemic and of its consequences on everyday life. In other words, other than undergoing some sort of habituation effect over time, dreaming activity in a large part of the population appears to have been significantly shaped by current public events in their development over time. In this perspective, our findings add support to the idea, proposed by several authors (Schredl & Bulkeley, 2020) , that dream features and their changes may be considered as a useful index of psychological impact in emergency situations.",
