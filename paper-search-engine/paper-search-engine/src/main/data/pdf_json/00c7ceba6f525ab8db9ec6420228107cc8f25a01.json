Emerging evidence demonstrates the efficacy of PM+ across a range of settings. However, the published literature rarely documents the adaptation processes for psychological interventions to context or culture, including curriculum or implementation adaptations. Practical guidance for adapting PM+ to context while maintaining fidelity to core psychological elements is essential for mental health implementers to enable replication and scale. This paper describes the process of contextually adapting PM+ for implementation in Rwanda, Peru, Mexico and Malawi undertaken by the international nongovernmental organization Partners In Health. To our knowledge, this initiative is among the first to adapt PM+ for routine delivery across multiple public sector primary care and community settings in partnership with Ministries of Health. Lessons learned contribute to a broader understanding of effective processes for adapting low-intensity psychological interventions to real-world contexts.",

We summarise the sequential adaptation of PM+ to context beginning with Rwanda, leveraging our understanding of necessary considerations for PM+ implementation across multiple sites. Given the breadth of this work, we aim to share lessons learned that can contribute to a broader understanding of effective processes for cross-site adaption of low-intensity psychological interventions to real-world contexts.

PIH, known locally as Inshuti Mu Buzima (IMB), has supported public health system strengthening in three rural districts for 15 years. Following the successful integration of basic mental health service delivery for the most severe conditions into community and primary care settings in Burera district (Smith et al., 2017a,b) , PIH/IMB identified the need to introduce a psychological intervention such as PM+ into its service delivery framework to address common mental health conditions. Upon identifying the need for a psychological intervention, an effective process for intervention adaptation and implementation was articulated. Our approach reflects evidence based recommendations for adapting psychological interventions to culture and context. Cultural adaptations include \"systematic modifications of a psychological intervention that consider cultural patterns, meanings, and value to those who will receive the intervention\". Furthermore, contextual adaptation reflects considerations of the broader social, economic and political context of intervention recipients and the health system (Bernal & S\u00e1ez Santiago, 2006; Bernal et al., 2009; Movsisyan et al., 2019) . Elements of formal cultural and contextual adaptation frameworks were considered while attending to site needs for timely and practical service capacity building to address common mental health conditions.

Guidance around the flexibility of the session length and number was added, particularly as providers found active listening beneficial for patients which often took longer than the time allotted in the 90-minute protocol. Furthermore, the WHO Psychological Outcomes Profile scale (PSYCHLOPS) was modified for literacy levels using a visual analogue mood scale instead of numbers. Five local community mental health workers (CMHWs) with elementary to high school education were hired to deliver PM+. Training preparation and adaptation were done in partnership with SES, contextualising Peru's materials. SES colleagues travelled from Peru to Mexico to facilitate the PM+ training with CES for CMHWs in June 2019. A local psychologist was hired for weekly supervision, case management and CMHW continuing education. The existing depression care pathway was expanded for broader common mental health conditions addressed by PM+. PM+ was delivered by CMHWs at home visits, and participants were invited to join existing psychoeducation groups. To address high rates of trauma, separate training focused on grief, bereavement care, psychological first aid and trauma. This equipped CMHWs to provide trauma desensitisation sessions and/or violence safety planning for patients who disclosed traumatic experiences, before delivering PM+. Monthly staff meetings coordinated community-and facility-based care and provided interdisciplinary guidance on managing complex cases identified by CMHWs (Rodr\u00edguez-Cuevas et al., 2021).",

            "text": "Abwenzi Pa Za Umoyo (APZU), PIH Malawi's sister organisation in rural Neno district, has partnered with the Malawian MoH since 2007 including supporting the growth of mental health services. Malawi has some of the least available mental health funding, specialised human resource capacity and clinical services in Africa (Udedi, 2016) . Mental health care supported by APZU is provided by mid-level nonspecialist clinical officers and nurses through the decentralised Integrated Chronic Care Clinic, combining human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), non-communicable diseases (NCD) and mental health services within APZU-supported primary health care facilities in Neno. An advanced mental health clinic at Neno District Hospital and Lisungwi Community Hospital provides support to patients with severe mental health conditions and epilepsy. However, there remains a paucity of counselling and care for people with common mental health conditions. APZU began to adapt PM+ for the Malawian context in 2019. APZU was the first PIH site to implement group PM+ as it was innovative, cost-effective given limited providers, had the potential to reach a wider population and the peer support approach was deemed appropriate for the context. As the group PM+ manual was not yet publicly available at the time of adaptation, APZU obtained WHO approval to use the group model. The initial population APZU targeted for PM+ delivery was women in the perinatal period, due to the higher risk of depression during this time. This further informed the decision to implement group PM+, as group counselling has been shown to be effective for women with postpartum depression (Zlotnick et al., 2001) . Three lay health counsellors with secondary education and one psychologist supervisor were hired. The Rwandan PM+ materials were contextually adapted in collaboration with IMB, referring to WHO manuals. An additional mental health background was added to the training materials for the lay counsellors, along with guidance on facilitating PM+ in group settings. The curriculum was adapted to address the target population, including case examples of women with postpartum depression, and content added regarding sexual, gender-based violence and abuse. In October 2019, the psychologist supervisor from the IMB team travelled to Malawi to assist with the PM+ training. Once completed, lay counsellors, supervised by the psychologist, began collaboration with antenatal and postpartum nurses at the health facility through community sensitisation and screening women for depression.",

Most literature describing the adaptation of psychological interventions to context takes place within research settings and rarely articulates the adaptation process for routine care delivery, as was done with local implementers and stakeholders within PIH supported public sector health systems. Although each site is unique, sites employed similar adaptation methods that have applicability across other settings. Key cross-site adaptations contextualised for implementation in local settings are summarised in Box 2. Lessons learned can contribute to easier PM+ adaptation in new contexts, which may lack the required financial and human resources that are often available with research studies.",

This provided a framework for one site to learn from another's adaptation, while maintaining the core components. For example, after the Rwandan team contextualised case studies, the Malawi team adapted those cases for perinatal depression. We also found curriculum and training should be adapted to the trainee background and skill level. For example, more general mental health background was included in Malawi, whereas in Rwanda, more clinical information was added for nurses based on their prior mental health care delivery experience. It is also important to note practical adaptation and translation can be a time-intensive process, as contextualisation is necessary for both training and implementation. Proximity to the field and target populations was fundamental for iterative adaptation, and service user feedback will continue being collected as part of our ongoing evaluation of PM+ rollout across sites. Sharing lessons learned together with other PM+ implementers and materials (such as slides, manuals, pre-post tests and tools) can expedite the adaptation process. Our adaptation period was shortened from approximately 1 year in Rwanda to 4 months in Mexico and Malawi due to cross-site collaborations.",

Additionally, guidance on effective PM+ data collection methods and platforms were not provided in the initial PM+ intervention manual, thus all sites integrated PM+ information into ongoing data collection systems for symptom tracking, and to monitor quality of care and intervention uptake. For example, Rwanda integrated PM+ into the government health facilities' electronic medical records system.

Formal evaluation is needed to determine if the adaptation processes ultimately resulted in effective PM+ implementation and to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of PM+ in routine settings. Furthermore, given the existing MoH and NGO infrastructure available in our settings, a cost-effectiveness study could help determine the feasibility of this process for replication and scale.

Furthermore, this adaption model can be replicated. For example, leveraging lessons learned from this process, early phases of PM+ adaptation are underway for delivery in the United States by a mobile outreach van in urban Boston and by social work students in Florida. With the emergence of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, PM+ could be used across multiple platforms to support populations affected by the pandemic.
