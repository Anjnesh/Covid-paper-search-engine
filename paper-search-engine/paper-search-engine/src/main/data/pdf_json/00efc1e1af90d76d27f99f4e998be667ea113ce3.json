In the media, we are witnessing an explosion of initiatives of citizen science, the \"science of ordinary citizens\" or the \"science without scientists\" (Irwin, 1995) ; and we can say that the pandemic invites us to rethink the indicators of Responsible Research and Innovation (Archibugi, 2014) for a redetermination of the effectiveness in the exchange between the knowledge of scientists and the experiential knowledge of communities (Foray, 2012) . At this juncture, one of the tasks that researchers in the social sciences and humanities can take upon themselves is verifying the Societal Readiness Levels, i.e., the levels of integration into society of new technologies, products, and services (IFD-Innovation Fund Denmark, 2019) .",

In this context, it is useful to keep in mind that the need for expressions of citizen science implies a connection to the \"fragility of experiential knowledge,\" i.e., the knowledge that-although not scientific-is produced through the experience activity of the laity. Experiential knowledge-Dominique Foray has stated-is local, since it arises from particular experiences and applies to very particular contexts. It is fragile, since not only are few people who possess it, but as it does not have a comprehensive codification, it is not easy to transmit it, and it disappears when the people who activated it disappear (Foray, 2012: 272-273) .",

At the local level, the availability of correct information to people with relevant competencies and skills, at the right time and in the right form, is a key dimension in coping with emergencies. Typically, conflicts arise about whether, how, and when to distribute information. In this respect, Italian inner areas have faced critical situations. It has been shown that a proper assessment of local hazards and vulnerabilities can enhance community resilience (Pagliacci and Russo, 2019a) .",
