Posters give the opportunity to present the author's work in an attractive way. They can be created for a number of reasons, including communicating the progress that a research project is making, to look for collaborators for future research projects, as an alternative to a traditional conference presentation, as an effective entry to the development of professional presentations (Durkin 2011) or to further a career. Creating a poster provides the author with a pleasing visual record of their research, which can be displayed publicly after the conference. Academic posters are also created in order to increase a researcher's impact in a particular field of research, which may open up future research and employment opportunities.",
