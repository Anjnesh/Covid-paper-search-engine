[3] [4] [5] As the site of the epidemic outbreak, China quickly adopted the most comprehensive, thorough, and strict prevention and control measures in the face of this public health emergency. Traditional \"non-medical\" prevention and control measures, such as city closure, community isolation, and suspension of population movement, have achieved remarkable results. 6, 7 These prevention and control measures have had notable success in preventing the virus from infecting healthy people; however, there is a specific group of people who need particular attention in this outbreak, namely, older adults with chronic diseases. With better health care and lower fertility rates, the world population is aging more quickly than ever. 8 According to the official website of the National Bureau of Statistics of China, by the end of 2019, the proportion of individuals > 60 years old in China reached 18.1%, and the elderly population is increasing annually. 9 Because of the increase in the aging population, the number of patients with chronic diseases is also gradually rising. Almost half (53.2%) of adults > 60 years old in China suffer from hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. 10, 11 Although the general population is susceptible to the novel coronavirus, older adults with chronic disease are among high-risk groups and have more serious clinical manifestations and consequences following infection. 12, 13 Further, chronic diseases in older patients are characterized by prolonged illness, as well as high rates of mortality and disability, 14 and such individuals need to attend hospital regularly for re-examination and take medicine for the rest of their lives.",

In one aspect, they are trapped in strict community isolation, routine hospital visits are suspended, and they are subject to other epidemic prevention policies. 7 On the other hand, while they are a population at high-risk from COVID-19, they also need to leave home for medical treatment, to acquire medications, and for regular check-ups, [12] [13] [14] representing a major conflict with epidemic prevention policies. In the face of public health emergencies, the public often evaluates the risk of unknown public health emergencies based on personal experience, and the perception of risk will affect the response behavior to public health emergencies. 15 Therefore, it is an important public health issue to understand how elderly patients with chronic diseases perceive and respond to the risk of the epidemic.",

However, it is precisely because of the instantaneous information overload that older patients with chronic diseases in particular initially found it difficult to respond appropriately, as making specific plans related to the disease in advance became more challenging, and their attention was more strongly influenced by developments in the epidemic. With the spread of the virus, a genuine crisis related to the daily lives of older adult patients with chronic diseases appears as a result of tougher lockdown and preventive measures and medicine shortages. For older adult patients with chronic diseases, there is an irreconcilable contradiction between not being able to go out and the need to go out regularly to buy medicine and the need for medical care visits, which leads to the dilemma of treatment delay and drug interruption. Therefore, this stage mainly manifested as a response to dramatic changes tin the external environment and familiar rules governing the operation of daily life, and it was difficult to make accurate and timely responses to these risks over a short period of time; that is, it is only when the real dangers in daily life collided with the external world that older adults, a specific group of people with chronic diseases, genuinely perceived the occurrence of risk.",

At this stage, the state could advocate only non-pharmaceutical public health interventions, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks, and maintaining social distance. 25 With travel limitations, the lifestyle of older adults with chronic diseases changed, becoming contrary to their accustomed daily life.

Although traditional \"non-medical\" prevention and control measures, such as city closures, community isolation, and suspension of population movement, had remarkable success and avoided viral infection of healthy people to a great extent, the relatively strict quarantine measures also impeded access to medical treatment and check-ups for a large group of older adults with chronic diseases. From one perspective, these people were trapped by strict community isolation, hospital suspensions, and other prevention policies, unable to go out, and found it difficult to obtain the medicines they needed. From another point of view, although older adults with chronic disease are at high risk of COVID-19 infection, they still need to go out regularly for medical treatment and hospital follow-up. 10,11 \"Unforeseen outcomes\" of social actions are consequences that social actors have neither deliberately created nor anticipated, and these \"consequences\" are opposed to the original intention of the social actions. 30 Unforeseen consequences can be far-reaching, affecting all groups of the population (e.g., service providers, community members, vulnerable groups) and all sectors of society (e.g., health, education, environment, economy, law). 31 Large-scale implementation of multi-mode infection prevention and control strategies has achieved epidemic control, and the infection rates of other infectious diseases have remained stable, or even decreased, because of good adherence to use of personal protective equipment and hand hygiene. 32 However, in this study, we describe how excessively strict prevention and control measures also resulted in interruptions to medication supply and delayed medical treatment for older patients with chronic disease.

Of our three outcome themes, travel restrictions were the first to be perceived as a risk by this group of patients. Hence, based on travel restrictions, with the increasing number of confirmed cases and research on COVID-19, the outbreak entered a specific phase. In this stage, news and media communication gradually become the main source for their perception of risk. The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly created a general climate of anxiety, fear, uncertainty, and insecurity, 33 and the risk of a second or third pandemic wave cold also create fear, uncertainty, and anxiety among people around the globe. 34 COVID-19 can influence the psychology and behavior of populations, 35 such as the irrational crowd looting behavior to obtain Shuanghuanglian oral liquid, caused by panic. 36 Further, for older adult patients with chronic disease living in the community, risk perception of the epidemic is not limited to such phenomena. Over time, some unavoidable problems emerged one by one. Insufficient stock of medicines coupled with an inability to go out to buy medicines, and needing to access hospitals for medical treatment because acute or chronic disease while the medical services were closed, became their main sources of risk at this stage. Therefore, an exploration of the trajectory of risk perception can also guide the need for sufficient understanding of the mechanisms underlying risk perception in the future to control the effects of each contributory factor.",

The government implemented different levels of risk management in different areas, and daily life gradually resumed. 20 Permission to conduct the interviews was obtained from each participant and the community health service center. The principal researcher interviewed participants, while another member of the research team provided support, including managing the recordings. Before the interview, the purpose of our study and principles of voluntary participation, confidentiality, and willingness to participate were explained to participants. Interviews were recorded and notes were made throughout after obtaining informed consent. The final interview guide included the following questions: (a) Since the outbreak of COVID-19, when did you first start to pay attention to COVID-19? By what means? (News/TV/Internet/Other People); (b) What aspects or phenomena made you realize the seriousness of the COVID-19 epidemic? (c) What measures are being taken in your community to cope with COVID-19? (d) Do the COVID-19 outbreak and quarantine measures taken by the community make any impact or inconvenience you in your life? If so, what are the main aspects of this inconvenience? Do you think this influence or inconvenience is large (in terms of its effects on your daily life and medical treatment)?

All participants agreed with the analysis after review. Each theme is reported with examples of the original words of the participants. Theme 1: Restricted Travel Since 2019, COVID-19 has gradually spread throughout the world. China rapidly slowed the spread of disease by adopting municipal isolation, community isolation, and suspension of traditional \"medicine,\" along with prevention and control measures, such as migration suspension. Therefore, most regions of China were not severely affected; however, for a large number of ordinary residents, daily life was effectively suspended, and public life was greatly limited at different levels.",

Because older adults with chronic diseases are at high risk of COVID-19, fear of infection was their most prominent psychological experience.\"During the outbreak, when I heard someone nearby coughing or having a fever, I would get so nervous that I would lock my door and not go out, in case someone new infected me.\" (P8) \"I get scared when I see the news on TV. Especially when I saw the increase in the number of cases reported on the news every day, I was afraid that I would get infected and then be sent to the hospital to be quarantined, because I heard that after being sent to be quarantined, I could not come out.\" (P11)",

The perceptions of individuals of different risks from the outside world also have different characteristics at different periods and stages.24 As described in this study, the perception of epidemic risk among older patients with chronic disease living in the community had different characteristics during different stages of the outbreak. In the early stage of the epidemic, faced with an outbreak of an unknown virus, blocking the transmission route became the most important prevention and control method, 25 with travel restriction the main prevention and control measure. Sensitive groups could intuitively feel the huge changes occurring in the external environment and influencing their familiar daily life; however, the specific impact of such changes on daily life has yet to be subject to clear reflection. At this stage, individuals adopt a relatively calm, \"wait-and-see\" attitude. In contrast, in the middle stage of the epidemic, with comprehensive coverage in various media, negative",
