Previous studies showed that mosquito-derived factors present in saliva or salivary gland extract (SGE) contribute to the pathogenesis of dengue. In this study, we aimed to investigate the interplay between mosquito vector and DENV and to address the question of whether the mosquito vector alters the virus that leads to consequential disease manifestations in the mammalian host. DENV2 cultured in C6/36 cell line (culture-DENV2) was injected to Aedes aegypti intrathoracically. Saliva was collected from infected mosquitoes 7 days later. Exploiting the sensitivity of Stat1 -/mice to low dose of DENV2 delivered intradermally, we showed that DENV2 collected in infected mosquito saliva (msq-DENV2) induced more severe hemorrhage in mice than their culture counterpart. Msq-DENV2 was characterized by smaller particle size, larger plaque size and more rapid growth in mosquito as well as mammalian cell lines compared to culture-DENV2. In addition, msq-DENV2 was more efficient than culture-DENV2 in inducing Tnf mRNA production by mouse macrophage. Together, our results point to the possibility that the mosquito vector provides an environment that alters DENV2 by changing its growth characteristics as well as its potential to cause disease.",

It is estimated that there are over 390 million dengue virus (DENV) infections per year globally [1] and 500,000 of the infected require hospitalization [2] [3] [4] . The World Health Organization classifies dengue into dengue and severe dengue. Approximately one-third of dengue patients may have hemorrhage manifestations, the spectrum includes mild skin hemorrhage, gingival or nasal bleeding, gastroinetestinal bleeding and severe hemorrhage [5] . Patients with severe dengue experience plasma leakage, severe bleeding, fluid accumulation, respiratory stress or organ impairment and are at risk of death [5] . It is, therefore, evident that hemorrhage is a clinically significant sign of DENV infection.",

            "text": "The Aedes mosquitoes, principally Aedes aegypti (A. aegypti) and A. albopictus, are the primary vectors that transmit DENV to humans [4] . DENV is taken up by the mosquito during an infectious blood meal. The virus infects the midgut epithelium and replicates before it traverses the basal lamina into the hemolymph and disseminates throughout the mosquito body. It reaches the salivary glands from where it is released to the saliva and transmitted to the mammalian host [6] . Of the interplay between mosquitoes, virus, and mammalian host, many studies focused on the impact of mosquito saliva, salivary gland proteins or mosquito bites on the establishment of infection or disease progression in the mammalian host. Cox et al. compared infection of humanized IRF3 -/-7 -/mice with DENV through infected mosquito bite and by needle injection. They found that mice infected by mosquito probing exhibited more severe disease, higher and more sustained viremia, erythema and thrombocytopenia compared to infection through needle inoculation [7] . A different study also showed that infecting IRF3 -/-7 -/mice with DENV through infected mosquito bite resulted in higher viremia titer two days preceding the peak [8] . Probing by na\u00efve mosquitoes before needle injection of DENV also increased viremia titer but downregulated TLR7, RelA, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 transcripts during the first 3 to 6 h of infection compared to needle delivery of the virus [9] . These studies demonstrated that mosquito salivary factors delivered through probing modulate DENV replication, immune response as well as disease progression in the host. However, how the mosquito vector impacts the pathogenicity of the virus has not been addressed. Here we aimed to focus our study on the interplay between the mosquito vector and DENV and to address the question of whether the mosquito vector alters the virus so that it affects the consequential disease manifestations in the mammalian host.",

TNF deficiency or depletion by neutralizing antibody diminished DENV-induced hemorrhage [10] . Immunodeficient mice including AG129 mice that lack type I and II IFN receptors, Ifnar -/mice lacking type I IFN receptor, IRF3 -/-7 -/and Stat1 -/-(signal transducers and activators of transcription 1) have been demonstrated to be susceptible to DENV infection [8, [11] [12] [13] [14] .

As outlined in Fig 1A, saliva was collected from na\u00efve (na\u00efve saliva) and DENV2-infected mosquitoes (infectious saliva) [15] . Stat1 -/mice which had been determined for their high susceptibility to low dose of DENV (S1 Fig) were divided into four groups: mice that were intradermally injected with (I) DENV2 grown in cell culture (culture-DENV2), (II) culture-DENV2 pre-mixed with saliva from na\u00efve mosquitoes, (III) saliva from DENV2-infected mosquitoes (infectious saliva containing DENV2), and (IV) culture-DENV2 premixed with UV-treated infectious saliva. Each mouse was injected with 6 \u00d7 10 3 PFU of DENV2 regardless whether the virus was obtained from cell culture or from infected mosquitoes (Fig 1B) . Fig 2A shows that hemorrhage developed in dorsal and abdominal skins but not subcutaneous tissues in all four groups of mice on day 6 after infection. Mice that were inoculated with culture-DENV2 alone, culture-DENV2 pre-mixed with na\u00efve mosquito saliva and culture-DENV premixed with UV-inactivated infectious saliva had similar level of severity supernatants were collected and virus titer was determined by plague assay (culture-DENV2). Culture-DENV2 was mixed with saliva collected from na\u00efve Aedes aegypti (culture-DENV + na\u00efve saliva). A. aegypti was intrathoracically inoculated with 69 nl of DENV-2 16681 (6.9 \u00d7 10 2 PFU in 69 nl) and saliva was collected on day 7 after infection (infectious saliva). Culture-DENV2 was mixed with infectious saliva that was exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light (culture-DENV2 + UV-inactivated infectious saliva). The titer of DENV2 from either cell culture or infectious mosquitoes was determined by plaque assay and adjusted to 6 \u00d7 10 3 PFU in 400 \u03bcl. (Fig 2A and 2B) . Consistent with our previous finding, hematoxylin-eosin stain revealed that there was red blood cell extravasation and leukocyte infiltration in the hemorrhaged skin (Fig 2C) [15] . While mice given infectious saliva had more severe red blood cell extravasation and greater number of leukocytes infiltrating the abdominal skin compared to mice given culture-DENV2 alone and culture-DENV2 premixed with na\u00efve saliva, the levels of red blood cell extravasation and leukocyte infiltration were similar in dorsal skins from all other three groups of mice ( Fig 2C) . In line with severe hemorrhage development, 2 out of 6 mice injected infectious saliva developed viremia while none of the mice in the other groups did (S2 Fig). These results suggest that DENV2 in infectious mosquito saliva (msq-DENV2) has higher hemorrhage induction potential than virus obtained from cell culture and that mosquito saliva, whether it is from na\u00efve or infected mosquitoes, does not potentiate hemorrhage induction ability of culture-DENV2 in Stat1 -/mice.",

Infectious mosquito saliva (containing msq-DENV2) was placed on C6/36 cell monolayers and the supernatant was harvested 7 days later. Virus titer in the supernatants was determined by plaque assay. Virus thus obtained after one cell culture passage (msq-DENV2-P1) was again compared to culture-DENV2 for their potential to induce hemorrhage in Stat1 -/mice. Mice were injected intradermally with culture-DENV2 or msq-DENV2-P1 at the same titer (6 \u00d7 10 3 PFU). Hemorrhage development in both the dorsal and abdominal skins was observed on day 6 after inoculation ( Fig 3A) . Notably, mice receiving msq-DENV2-P1 developed more severe hemorrhage in the abdominal skin than those given culture-DENV2 (Fig 3A and 3B) . These results together with those from Fig 2 indicate that DENV2 infecting mosquitoes acquires greater potential that is independent of the effect of mosquito saliva to induce hemorrhage in mice. Moreover, msq-DENV2 retains its hemorrhage potentiation ability after one passage in mosquito cell line.",

SGE contains not only saliva but also secreted and non-secreted salivary proteins as well as disrupted mosquito cells. These additional mosquito elements that may or may not be delivered during mosquito probing, modulate host immune response to the virus [8, 9, 24, 25] . Amongst these approaches, injecting saliva to the host is closest to probing if one disregards the difference in mechanical damage caused by needle injection and probing. Conventionally, mosquito saliva is collected by allowing individual mosquitoes to salivate into a capillary tube [25] . The small volume of saliva collected by this method makes it difficult to quantify and characterize the virus contained in the saliva. The method we collect saliva from mosquitoes in this study has recently been published [15] . DENV-infected mosquitoes are fed on a parafilm-wrapped artificial feeder and allowed to salivate into the feed. Saliva from as many as 200 mosquitoes can be simultaneously collected, enough quantity to determine viral titer, plaque size and growth characteristics. Saliva collected from infected mosquitoes by this method contained approximately 1 \u00d7 10 5 PFU/ml after 4-5-fold concentration, a titer high enough to conduct in vivo experiments in the mammalian host. This approach is useful for studies involving interactions between virus and the mosquito vector as well as its consequential effect on disease progression in the host. analyzed by Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Representative images are shown below the graph and in S3 Fig. (C) BHK-21 cells were infected with culture-DENV2 or msq-DENV2-P1 at a MOI of 0.01. C6/36 and ATC10 cells were infected with culture-DENV2 or msq-DENV2-P1 at a MOI of 0.1. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay. One-way ANOVA with Dunn's multiple comparisons test was used to compare the differences in viral titers between culture-DENV2 and msq-DENV2-P1 with data from multiple time points. (D) ATC10 culture supernatants collected at different time points were analyzed for E protein expression by Western blot (upper gel).

While the proteolytic activity of NS2B3 protease degrades the key adaptor protein of type I interferon pathway, human mediator of IRF3 activation (MITA), it is not able to degrade its mouse counterpart MPYS [27] . This phenomenon limits the usefulness of immunocompetent mice to study dengue. We established a dengue hemorrhage mouse model in immunocompetent mice that requires intradermal inoculation of high titers (10 7~1 0 9 PFU) of DENV for hemorrhage manifestation [10] , a titer that is not achievable by isolating virus from infected mosquito saliva. Immunodeficient mice including AG129 mice, Ifnar -/mice, IRF3 -/-7 -/and Stat1 -/have been demonstrated to be susceptible to DENV infection [8, [11] [12] [13] [14] . JAK/STAT signaling is critical for the production of antiviral proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines [28] . Mice that lack the Stat1 gene are defective in their ability to respond to both type I and II IFNs and are highly susceptible to viral and intracellular bacterial infections [14, [29] [30] [31] [32] . Our study showed that Stat1 -/mice are responsive to gradient titers of DENV2 and the severity of hemorrhage development correlates with the titers of the viral inocula (S1 Fig) delivered through the intradermal route. These results support the notion that Stat1 -/mice and possibly other mice deficient in type I IFN signaling can be applied to investigate the subtle differences in pathogenicity of different DENV isolates, especially in hemorrhage manifestations. Hemorrhaged areas as quantified by ImageJ software can be used as an indicator for DENV pathogenicity.",

Saliva was collected from infected mosquitoes and UV-irradiated to inactivate the virus. Na\u00efve saliva and UV-irradiated infectious saliva were separately mixed with culture-DENV2 before injecting Stat1 -/mice. No difference was observed in the severity of hemorrhage manifestations between these two groups and that of control mice receiving culture-DENV. These results suggest that mosquito saliva, either from na\u00efve or from infected mosquitoes, does not affect DENV2-induced hemorrhage in the mammalian host (Fig 2) . In addition, infectious mosquito saliva was diluted and plated on C6/36 cells at MOI of 0.01 to allow virus propagation. Msq-DENV2-P1 in the culture supernatant, like its parental msq-DENV2, has higher potency than culture-DENV2 in inducing hemorrhage development (Fig 3) . By these two experiments, we rule out the effect of mosquito saliva and demonstrate that DENV2 became more potent after infecting mosquitoes in inducing hemorrhage in mice.",

            "text": "RNA viruses are known to have high mutation rates due to the error-prone nature of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [33] . The viral population is consisted of high numbers of variant genomes called quasispecies. Genetic mutation that changes the composition of quasispecies impacts viral replication, plaque morphology and the pathogenesis of the disease it causes [34] [35] [36] . We observed that after infecting mosquitoes msq-DENV2 displays larger plague size compared to the original inoculum (culture-DENV2). After one cell culture passage in C6/36 cells, msq-DENV2-P1 collected from culture supernatants retains the ability to induce severe hemorrhage as its parental msq-DENV2 and exhibits smaller virion size, higher growth rate in both mammalian and mosquito cell lines as well as greater efficiency than culture-DENV2 in inducing Tnf production in mouse macrophages. These observations suggest that spontaneous mutation may occur to DENV2 in the mosquito vector thus impacts the composition of quasispecies, resulting in alteration of the characteristics of the virus. Although it remains to be determined whether there are mutation hotspots in the viral genome and what the hotspots are, to our knowledge this study is the first to show that the mosquito vector provides an environment that allows DENV2 to go through genetic diversification for greater virulence. As DENV has four serotypes and A. albopictus is also a vector that transmits the virus, further experiments is required to determine whether serotypes 1, 3, and 4 also undergo changes in the mosquito vector, be it A. aegypti or A. albopictus. We reported previously that silencing the expression of salivary protein AsSG34 in A. agypti reduces DENV2 replication in the salivary gland and transmission of the virus to Stat1 -/mice [19] . Buchman et al. created A. agypti mosquitoes carrying a gene encoding an engineered single-chain variable fragment derived from a broadly neutralizing DENV human monoclonal antibody [37] . These mosquitoes have reduced vector competence and limited ability to acquire and transmit pathogens. In light of our finding that A. aegypti vector allows DENV2 to become more virulent, it is our speculation that disrupting viral growth in and blocking transmission of the virus by mosquitoes through molecular biological means may be a promising strategy to control the spread of dengue.",

Compared to culture-DENV2, msq-DENV2 is smaller in size, forms larger plaques and grows at a higher rate in both mosquito and mammalian cell cultures.
