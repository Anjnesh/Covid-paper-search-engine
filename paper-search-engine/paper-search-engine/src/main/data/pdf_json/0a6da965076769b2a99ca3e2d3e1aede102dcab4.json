These challenges related to the work community make employees feel exhausted which has led to an increase in sick leaves, further adding to the workload for those still at work and employees' worries about coping at work (Ruotsalainen et al., 2020; Vehko et al., 2018) . In light of these situations, it is important to promote home care workers' occupational well-being and work ability, avoid staff overload and maintain the availability of home care workers.",

Similarly as with occupational well-being, there are several definitions of work ability (see e.g. Ilmarinen, 2009; Tengland, 2010) . Work ability is often only perceived as an individual resource related to health, competence, values, attitudes and motivation in relation to job requirements, such as managing work (Ilmarinen et al., 2008; Tengland, 2010) . The present study perceives work ability as a wider concept that comprises health and functional capacity, professional experience, values, attitudes, work environment and work demands, and that is also related to the work organization, work community and society (Ilmarinen et al., 2008) . This theoretical framework for work ability called the house of work ability model consists of the resources of the individual worker and work-related factors, and the social environment. Therefore, good work ability is fostered by a balance between the individual worker's resources and work factors. (Ilmarinen et al., 2008 , Ilmarinen, 2019 .",

Social support has been perceived as one of the dimensions of social capital (Nieminen et al., 2013) . Putnam (1995) defines social capital as networks, norms, and trust, which enable participants to act together more effectively to pursue shared objectives. According to Hyypp\u00e4 (2010) , communality and social capital can be considered as parallel concepts. Communality and social capital emerge from the trust, open communication, interaction, participation and learning of the members of the organization (P\u00e4rn\u00e4nen, 2006; Saaranen et al., 2015) . High social capital is associated with good organization of work at the workplace (P\u00e4rn\u00e4nen, 2006) , and social capital can be seen as a determinant of health (Hyypp\u00e4, 2010; Kouvonen et al., 2008; Oksanen et al., 2008) . These work community factors and resources are also fundamental in work-related theoretical models, such as the Demand-Control-Support model and Job Demands-Resources model (see Demerouti et al., 2001; Johnson & Hall, 1988) .",

According to Van der Heijden et al. (2017) , the quality of leadership and social support from leaders and colleagues have been found to be positively associated with the occupational well-being of the nurses (incl. home care) and reduce psychological distress. Recognition by supervisors and organization has also been found to promote job satisfaction among home care workers (Jang et al., 2017) . By contrast, a lack of social support and low decisionmaking power have been reported to negatively influence employee well-being (Hirschl & Gondim, 2020) .

First descriptive analysis (frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, maximum) was used to describe the demographics, occupational well-being, work ability and work community. Subsequently, an explorative factor analysis (EFA) was performed with maximum likelihood extraction and varimax rotation method to form unifying dimensions from the 11 items measuring the work community aspect of occupational well-being. The reliability of the factors was examined using the Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Based on preliminary EFA, two items were excluded because of relatively low communalities and factor loadings, and they did not fit into the theoretical structure. Therefore, the analysis was repeated with 9 items (Table 1) were missing at random from the data and were replaced with the mean of that item to perform the SEM analysis. SEM is an advanced statistical theory testing method combining factor and regression analysis and allowing the simultaneous examination of many equations. (Blunch, 2013 .) The SEM was conducted using a two-step approach; 1. Creating a measurement model with the variables and items mentioned above and testing the factor structure in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), 2. Constructing the structural equation model from the measured factors. The normality of the data was tested by examining kurtosis statistics, because SEM is based on the covariance structure. A critical ratio of the multivariate kurtosis value (10.532) indicated non-normality. Therefore, bootstrapping was used together with the maximum likelihood estimation method to improve the chi-squared test of model fit (Bollen-Stine bootstrap method) and",

(Ruotsalainen et al., 2020 .) The nature of work in home care may be relevant to these results. As occupational well-being can be considered very context-sensitive, the same predictors may not be universally valid in all contexts (Bartels et al., 2019) . Home care can be considered fairly independent work, which reduces the significance of support and assistance from colleagues and work atmosphere. However, the standardized indirect (mediated) and standardized total (direct and indirect) effect of Social support on all latent variables in the model was significant, indicating that Social support affects Occupational well-being and Work ability through employees' opportunities for affecting shift arrangements and Information and work organization. This result suggests that social support or influence on work shifts cannot alone predict occupational well-being or work ability in the context of home care; instead, information and work organization reinforce these connections.

Second, the reliability of this study is associated with material, formulation and the visual presentation of the model (see Kline, 1998) . The visual presentation of the model is simple, aiming to clarify the results for the reader; non-significant effects were deleted, resulting in providing visiblity to significant effects and squared multiple correlations (Blunch, 2013; Byrne, 2010) . Finally, the questionnaire was piloted and pre-tested for this study.",

Although the response rate in this survey was 45%, it can be considered generally moderate (Grove et al., 2013) . The study participants were given an opportunity to respond to the survey during working hours, indicating adequate representative of the target population. This makes it unlikely that only those who perceived their work ability as high responded to the survey. Moreover, this study fulfilled the widely used criterion for adequate sample sizes in EFA by Nunnally (1978) , namely at least ten cases per every variable (Osborne & Costello, 2004) . The model was overidentified (DF >1), which means estimated parameters exceeded the number of data points (variances and covariances) indicating an adequate sample size for SEM (Byrne, 2010) . In addition, the questionnaire used in the study was fairly long, which may have influenced responding. The indirect (mediated) effects and the conclusions drawn from them must also be treated with caution because of the cross-sectional study design. Confirmation of these results would require a longitudinal study design. As this was a study conducted in a particular municipal home care context, the results are not directly transferable to another context.",

Based on the modification indices, two error terms of Influence on work shifts factor were connected. The preliminary model had validity concerns with the work ability latent variable. Therefore, two single items, work ability in relation to physical and mental demands of the work, were combined into a sum variable (Work ability in relation to the demands of the job, scale 2-10) reducing the correlation between the factors of Occupational well-being and Work ability.

Influence on work shifts had a significant direct effect on Information and work organization. In this model, Information and work organization was the only significant work community factor directly affecting Occupational well-being. Occupational well-being had the significant direct effect on Work ability. (Figure 2, Table 4). Examining the indirect and total effects, Social support had a significant total and indirect positive effect on all latent variables in the model so that other work community factors and Occupational well-being served as positive mediators strengthening the effects.

Information and work organization strengthened the positive relationship of Influence on work shifts to Occupational well-being, and Occupational well-being and Information and work organizations strengthened the positive effect of Influence on work shifts on Work ability.
