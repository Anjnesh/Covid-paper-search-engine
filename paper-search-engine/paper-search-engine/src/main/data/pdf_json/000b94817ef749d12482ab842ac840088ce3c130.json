This accentuates the need for a therapy that can reduce the severity of COVID-19. Clinical trials have shown the effectiveness of remdesivir in shortening recovery time and decreasing progression to respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation. However, some studies have highlighted its lack of efficacy in patients on highflow oxygen and mechanical ventilation. This study uncovers some underlying immune response differences between responders and non-responders to remdesivir treatment. Immunological analyses revealed an upregulation of tissue repair factors BDNF, PDGF-BB and PIGF-1, as well as an increase in ratio of Th2-associated cytokine IL-4 to Th1associated cytokine IFN-g. Serological profiling of IgG subclasses corroborated this observation, with significantly higher magnitude of increase in Th2-associated IgG2 and IgG4 responses. These findings help to identify the mechanisms of immune regulation accompanying successful remdesivir treatment in severe COVID-19 patients.",

Although most of the patients are either asymptomatic or have mild disease, approximately 20% of COVID-19 patients suffer from severe clinical illness, with 5% progressing to critical stage with acute respiratory distress syndrome and the need for mechanical ventilatory support (1) (2) (3) . The demand on ventilators and intensive care unit (ICU) resources has overwhelmed the public health system globally, and led to an increase in fatality rates in some regions, exemplified in the Eastern Mediterranean, Southern Asia and South-East Asia regions (4) . In order to circumvent the shortage of medical resources and reduce mortality, developing or repurposing existing therapeutic strategies to ameliorate disease severity is paramount.",

A phase 3 trial showed faster recovery time, shorter time on oxygen, and lower rates of progression to non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation but no mortality difference (5) . However, some patients requiring low-flow oxygen continue to worsen despite RDV treatment, while RDV was not clearly beneficial for patients who require mechanical ventilation (5) . We investigated the underlying cytokine responses of RDV-treated severe COVID-19 patients and characterized the differential responses associated with clinical outcomes following RDV treatment. Findings indicated the differences in T-helper cell polarization between non-intubated patients requiring oxygen and intubated patients, which help delineate the therapeutic effectiveness of RDV in a subset of severe COVID-19 patients.",

Plasma samples were treated with 1% Triton \u2122 X-100 solvent-detergent (SD) mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for virus inactivation. Immune mediator concentrations were determined with the Luminex \u2122 assay, using the Cytokine/Chemokine/Growth Factor 45-plex Human ProcartaPlex \u2122 Panel 1 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Standards and plasma from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls were incubated with fluorescent-coded magnetic beads pre-coated with respective capture antibodies in a 96-well black clear-bottom plate. After washing, biotinylated detection antibodies were incubated with the cytokine-bound beads for one hour. Finally, streptavidin-PE was added and incubated for another 30 minutes. Measurements were acquired on the FLEXMAP \u00ae 3D (ThermoFisher Scientific) using xPONENT \u00ae 4.0 (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX, USA) acquisition software. Data analyses were performed on Bio-Plex Manager \u2122 6.1.1 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).

The cells were first incubated with plasma samples from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls (1:100 dilution in 10% fetal bovine serum, FBS), followed by a secondary incubation with a double stain, consisting of Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 (ThermoFisher Scientific; 1:500 dilution in 10% FBS) and propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; 1:2500 dilution). Cells were acquired on a LSRII 4 Laser flow cytometer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and analyzed using FlowJo (BD). A positive antibody response cutoff is defined as mean + 3SD of the healthy controls (n=22). The ratio of the IgG subclasses was calculated with the following formula, where the percentage binding refers to the proportion of each IgG subclass that is specific to the SARS-COV-2 spike protein.",

In contrast, a strong but late T h 1 response was associated with severe disease (16, 17) . To scrutinize if RDV switched the T h 1/T h 2 balance in severe patients following treatment, T h 2/T h 1 cytokine ratio (defined by IL-4/IFN-g ratio) was determined and compared between the responders and non-responders. Responders to RDV treatment had an increase in IL-4/IFN-g ratio, indicating an increase in T h 2 versus a T h 1 response, although a T h 1 response was still predominant. Notably, we also observed 2 responders (9.5%) having a decreasing IL-4/IFN-g ratio, but this variation could be due to the heterogeneity of our cohort. In contrast, non-RDVtreated controls did not have a similar change in T h cell polarization between matched timepoints 1 and 2 ( Figure 3A) . Importantly, RDV treatment did not affect the IL-4/IFN-g ratio in non-responders following treatment. Similarly, the difference in the cytokine ratio was not significant in non-RDV-treated patients who progressed to intubation ( Figure 3A) .",

            "text": "The efficacy of RDV on COVID-19 patients has been investigated in multiple independent studies. In our cohort, the RDV-treated patients were observed to have a longer hospitalization period, which could be a chance occurrence, rather than an effect of RDV. Nevertheless, the other clinical trials with larger sample sizes, like the ACTT-1 (NCT04280705) or SIMPLE-moderate (NCT04292730) trials, showed the clinical benefits of RDV in improving recovery times, without significant mortality benefits (5, 8, 21) . However, the subsequent SOLIDARITY trial by World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted the lack of impact of RDV to prevent death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (22). Here, we showed that the ratio of T h 2/T h 1 associated cytokines IL-4 and IFN-g was increased in favor of IL-4 in responders compared with nonresponders. In addition, other T h 2-associated immune signatures, like increased IL-21 and IL-6 in responders compared with untreated controls indicated a developing type 2 response (23, 24) . In addition, serology analysis revealed a significantly higher increase in the ratio of spike protein-specific IgG2/4 antibodies to IgG1/3 antibodies in responders, indicating an upregulation of T h 2 responses (18) . It has been shown that T cells have a prominent role during SARS-CoV-2 infection (12) (13) (14) 25) . especially during the convalescent phase, where a previous study highlighted the importance of robust memory T cell responses in protection against recurrent episodes of COVID-19 (26) . However, it remains debatable if T cell responses are helpful or harmful in COVID-19, or if different T cell subsets function independently to offer protection or mediate pathogenic inflammation during the acute phase of disease. A previous study reported a predominantly T h 1 response in patients requiring critical care (27) , while another study indicated that patients with mild disease had a normal T h 2 response (28) . These results corroborate our findings, where a higher T h 2 response was observed in responders to RDV treatment. Although the exact function of T h 2 in severe COVID-19 is unclear, it plays a critical role in reducing inflammation in other lung diseases (29, 30) , warranting further studies in COVID-19.",

In addition, the non-responders may be experiencing uncontrolled cytokine storm with overactive inflammation that was not reduced by RDV treatment. As such, combinatorial treatment with anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone (31, 32) or baricitinib (33, 34) are likely options to explore when treating severe COVID-19 patients. Indeed, a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of baricitinib and RDV combinatorial treatment highlighted the superior results compared with RDV alone, with shortening recovery time and improvement in clinical status among COVID-19 patients receiving high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation (33) . More importantly, the group receiving baricitinib co-treatment had a reduction in mortality rate by 35% compared to the RDV treatment group over the course of 28 days (33) .",
