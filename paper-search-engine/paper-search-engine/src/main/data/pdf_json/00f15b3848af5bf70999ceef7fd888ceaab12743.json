The individual decision-making process (i.e. at the micro level) has been mostly tackled by research psychologists (e.g. (1)), while decisions taken concerning national and international policies (i.e. the macro level) have been studied by political scientists (e.g. (2)). Finally, research utilization by organizations (i.e. the meso-level) has largely been the concern of organization and management scientists (3).",

Existing studies predominantly focus on evidence use by physicians (5), managers of healthcare facilities and decision-makers who are directly involved in policymaking (6).",

Beyer and Trice's framework encompasses four organizational processes: information processing, affective bonding, strategy formulation and control, and action generation. Information processing concerns the cognition of research through deliberate actions of sensing, searching and diffusing evidence. Affective bonding refers to evidence consumers' feelings about research. Evidence consumers' affective reaction, receptivity and commitment towards evidence use shape this organizational process. The organizational process of strategy formulation and control addresses behaviours following the recognition of research evidence by selecting, evaluating and providing feedback on research evidence. Action generation pertains to the adoption, use, and, sometimes, the institutionalization of evidence (7) . In previous analyses, scholars have set their focus on one of these organizational processes.",

Within the category of conceptual evidence use, potential evidence users consider multiple sources of evidence and other contextual factors influence actions (9) . This reflects the complexity of organizational processes arguably more realistically (13). Evidence production and consumption are therefore not bound to a linear, but a dynamic process. Conceptual evidence use can be described with the enlightenment (9) or the interactive model (11) . In the enlightenment model evidence 'creeps' into decisions, shaping them incrementally over a longer period (14). The interactive model in this category of evidence use is defined similarly to the enlightenment model. Though, this model focuses more specifically on the existence of collaborations among stakeholders (12) .",

In the tactical model, the content of the evidence is negligible as the fact that research is being conducted in the field is used as an argument.
