To date, several trials have aimed to examine whether treatment for depression improves CVD outcomes in patients with heart disease. The Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial (SADHART) evaluated use of an antidepressant sertraline versus placebo for depressed patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina, suggesting antiplatelet and endothelium-protective properties of sertraline [4] . The Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) trial was a randomized trial comparing cognitive behavioral therapy versus usual care following MI within the past 30 days [5] . However, there is not sufficient evidence regarding pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy for depression in prevention of cardiac events among Asian patients with diabetes. A large, randomized, controlled trial to address this question is required; however, patients with depression are at high risk for CVD and should not be assigned to a placebo group owing to ethical problems.",
