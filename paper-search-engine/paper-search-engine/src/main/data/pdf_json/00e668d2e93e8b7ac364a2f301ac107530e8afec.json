Although the traditional vaccine development process is quite long, more than ten COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for use in about a year. The COVID-19 vaccines that have been administered are highly effective enough, but achieving herd immunity is required to end the pandemic. The motivation of this study is to contribute to review the countries' vaccine policies and adjusting the manufacturing plans of the vaccine companies. In this study, the total number of people fully vaccinated against COVID-19 was forecasted in the US, Asia, Europe, Africa, South America, and the World with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, which is a new approach in vaccination studies. Additionally, for herd immunity, the percentage of fully vaccinated people in these regions at the beginning of 2021 summer was determined. ARIMA results show that in the US, Asia, Europe, Africa, South America, and the World will reach 139 million, 109 million, 127 million, 8 million, 38 million, and 441 million people will be fully vaccinated on 1 June 2021, respectively. According to these results, 41.8% of the US, 2.3% of Asia, 17% of Europe, 0.6% of Africa, 8.8% of South America, and 5.6% of the World population will be fully vaccinated people against the COVID-19. Results show that countries are far from the herd immunity threshold level desired to reach for safely slow or stop the COVID-19 epidemic.",

Although COVID-19 vaccines are highly efficacy enough, herd immunity is required to end the pandemic. Herd immunity can be achieved by vaccination or natural immunization. The fastest way to achieve https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107708 1568-4946/\u00a9 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V. herd immunity is vaccination. Herd immunity for the COVID-19 disease may vary from country to country because not every individual in the community can be vaccinated (for example, babies, pregnant women, those with medical problems, or those who do not want to be vaccinated). For this reason, reaching the minimum vaccination rate determined in order to achieve herd immunity is important in terms of eliminating the COVID-19 pandemic. The percentage of people who need to be immune to ensure herd immunity varies with each disease. Because this may vary depending on the vaccine, the population, the populations prioritized for vaccination, and other factors [33] . By forecasting the total number of fully vaccinated people by country, it can be observed that approximately how much of the population will be vaccinated and how close the threshold level for herd immunity has been reached. Estimating the future values of an observed time series plays an important role in many sciences and engineering fields. The main idea of the ARIMA model is to identify mathematical and statistical theory and then used it to forecast time-series data. Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is frequently used to predict future values due to its simple structure, flexibility, fast applicability and captures many different patterns [18] . In the past epidemics and health studies, the ARIMA time series model was successfully used [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . ARIMA models are also widely and successfully used for current COVID-19 epidemic research. Some studies using the ARIMA model for the COVID-19 epidemic are given in Table 2 .",

The ACF determine whether the previous value in the series is related to the following value. The PACF shows the amount of correlation between a variable and a lag of itself. When ACF and PACF graphs are examined, it is seen that the residuals generally do not exceed significant boundaries. Box-Ljung test was used to check the residuals are white noise or not. The null hypothesis (H 0 ) for a Box-Ljung test is the residuals are independently distributed. Therefore, it is desirable to reject the null hypothesis. Large p-value indicate that the residuals have no remaining autocorrelations, i.e., they resemble white noise. Box-Ljung test results of models are given in Table 6 . Fig. 3 shows that the residuals are white noise since all the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation coefficients are small and within two standard deviations at a 5% level of significance.

Models with the lowest values were selected to estimate the number of vaccines to be administered in the future. ARIMA(5,2,2), ARIMA(1,2,3), ARIMA(5,2,0), ARIMA(2,2,1), ARIMA(1,2,1) and ARIMA(5,2,1) models were selected for the US, Asia, Europe, Africa, South America, and the World, respectively. The selected ARIMA models fitted the data reasonably well with a minimum MAPE US = 1.27, MAPE Asia = 4.80, MAPE Europe = 4.24, MAPE Africa = 11.32, MAPE SouthAmerica = 0.90, and MAPE World = 1.39",

According to the results of this study, on June 1, 2021, in the US, Asia, Europe, Africa, South America, and, the World of 139 million, 109 million, 127 million, 8 million, 38 million, and 441 million people will be fully vaccinated, respectively. This result shows that beginning of the summer, 41.8%, 2.3%, 17%, 0.6%, 8.8%, and 5.6% of people will be fully vaccinated in the US, Asia, Europe, Africa, South America, and the World, respectively. It has been observed that the other regions except the US are quite far from the herd immunity threshold level. The future goal of our study is to forecast the number of fully vaccinated people in the future with deep learning time series models. Thus, the performances of the ARIMA model can be compared with the deep learning methods.",
