B16-MUC1 cells (from Cell Resource Center, Institute of Basic Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U mL \u22121 penicillin and 100 \uf06dg mL \u22121 streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 0.3 mg mL \u22121 G418. The cells were cultured at 37 \u2103 in a 5% CO 2 /air incubator. Mouse bone marrow cells were generated and cultured in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for one week to generate BMDCs. [2] Confocal microscopic images were performed on Leica SP8 using the following filters: \u03bbex@488 nm and \u03bbem@500\u2212530 nm for OVAp FITC ; \u03bbex@543 nm and \u03bbem@555-600 nm for LysoTracker Red. In vivo CTL studies were performed on a BD Accuri\u2122 C6 Plus Flow Cytometer. C57BL/6 female mice aged 6\u221210 weeks from Shandong University Laboratory Animal Center were used for all studies. All animal experiments were conducted by the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Shandong University.",
