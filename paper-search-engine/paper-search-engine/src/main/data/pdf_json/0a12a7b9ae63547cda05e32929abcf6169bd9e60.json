From the beginning of the outbreak until May 19, 2021, the total number of cases in Turkey reached 5,151,038, and the aggregate number of Covid-19-induced deaths corresponded to 45,419 (T.C. Sagl\u0131k Bakanl\u0131g\u0131 Covid-19 Bilgilendirme Platformu, 2021). As of March 17, all the activities of schools, theaters, cinemas, restaurants, coffee shops, internet cafes, indoor children's playgrounds, barbers, and hairdressers have been suspended in Turkey (Enli Tuncay, Koyuncu, & \u00d6 zel, 2020) . This extraordinary situation emerging in Turkey and across the world has adversely affected people from all walks of life. During the Covid-19 outbreak, the healthcare staff has assumed the biggest task in combating the disease in Turkey, as in the whole world, since the disease broke out and the first case was detected (\u015e enol \u00c7elik et al., 2021) .",

This global outbreak has ultimately grown into a trauma that is distressing and life-threatening for large segments of the world population. These traumatic effects may vary based on persons' cultural and individual characteristics, socioeconomic status, and psychological background. Uncertainty and fear of transmission as well as negative considerations regarding infection of themselves or family members, and unsanitary surroundings may be sources of intense anxiety (T\u00fcrkiye Psikiyatri Dernegi Ruhsal Travma ve Afet \u00c7al\u0131\u015fma Birimi, 2020). Anxiety refers to a disturbing emotion that may be experienced in certain periods of life, accompanied by physiological symptoms, and perceived as life-threatening or simply threatening (\u00d6zt\u00fcrk & Ulu\u015fahin, 2018; Zigmond & Snaith, 1983) . During this outbreak, not only society and infected individuals but also healthcare staff are physically and psychosocially affected by this process, both because they are members of the society and work in the frontline at grave risk (Puradollah & Ghasempour, 2020; Santarone, McKenney, & Elkbuli, 2020) .",

The escalating number of suspected and confirmed cases, workload, exhaustion of personal protective equipment, absence of particular drugs, discrimination, and fear of infecting family members may be accompanied by psychosocial problems among healthcare staff in Turkey (Kang et al., 2020) . Some published research reveals that healthcare staff developed negative psychological reactions to 2003 SARS pandemic (Chua et al., 2004; Maunder et al., 2003) . For instance, healthcare staff dealing with these patients are anxious about transmitting the disease to their family members, acquaintances, and coworkers (Bai et al., 2004; Maunder et al., 2003) . In addition, caring for Covid-19 patients may evoke feelings of uncertainty and stigmatization on them, leading them to work unwillingly, think about resignation, and suffer from considerable degree of stress, insomnia, anxiety and depression which might create long-run psychological impacts (Lai et al., 2020) .",

One report issued by World Health Organization (WHO) advises healthcare staff against feeling under pressure and stress (WHO, Mental health and psychosocial considerations during the COVID-19 outbreak, 2020a). Another WHO report likewise warns authorities against the likely escalation of depression among health care staff (WHO, Mental health and COVID-19, 2020b) . Depression denotes a state of feeling unhappy, dreary, and hopeless, having thoughts of inadequacy and worthlessness, exhibiting self-harming behaviors, isolating oneself from society, withdrawing into oneself, and being unable to enjoy anything as well as deterioration of appetite, sleep patterns, and sleep quality (\u00d6zt\u00fcrk & Ulu\u015fahin, 2018; Zigmond & Snaith, 1983 ). Sleep quality refers to a feeling of being fit, energetic, and ready for the new day after waking up. Sleep quality includes not only quantitative aspects of sleep such as sleep latency, sleep duration and number of awakenings per night but also subjective aspects, such as the depth and refreshing state of sleep. In addition, anxiety and depressive mood may also act on the sleep quality of individuals (Buysse et al., 1989) .",

The inclusion criteria encompassed working as a member of the healthcare staff (staff-cleaning staff, nurse, doctor, office staff, paramedic, medical secretary) at the above-mentioned healthcare facility and volunteering to participate in the research. On the other hand, our exclusion criteria included the healthcare staff who were on a leave of absence, took sick leave, and did not agree to participate in the study during the period (1 month) of the study. At the time of the research, 110 individuals were on a leave of absence, and 125 took sick leave. 257 individuals could not be included in the analysis due to missing data in the data collection forms, while 802 members of the healthcare staff refused to participate in the study. The research was conducted between April 17 and May 17, 2020 at the above-mentioned tertiary hospital which also served as a pandemic hospital. In terms of working routine of the hospital, the regular clinics continued their daily working order, while a pandemic clinic was also constructed and healthcare staff worked there in rotation. The working schedule of the hospital in question was arranged as two shifts (8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 4 p.m. to 8 a.m.) in all outpatient clinics, including the pandemic clinic. The average number of patients in the outpatient clinics ranges between 23 and 25. Besides, 5 nurses, 3 doctors, 1 medical secretary, 2 cleaning and care staff members, on average, work at the outpatient clinics during the day shift, yet each of these numbers is halved during the night shift.",

The researchers reported the Cronbach alpha value of PSQI as 0.80. In this study, the Cronbach's Alpha value for this scale was calculated as 0.87. The clinical and clinimetric properties of PSQI reveal that it can be utilized in both clinical practice and psychiatric research. PSQI is a scale that provides information on sleep quality and the type and severity of sleep disturbances in the last month. Out of 24 questions in total, 19 are rated by the respondents themselves, while the last 5 questions aimed at clinical information only and not included in scoring are rated by their spouses or roommates. In self-report questions, the 19th item, which questions whether a roommate or spouse is present, is excluded while calculating the component scores in the scale. Each item in the scale is weighted between 0 (no trouble) and 3 (serious distress) points. The sum of the scores for the seven sub-dimensions yields the global PSQI score which varies between 0 and 21. Sleep quality of those with a global score of 5 or less is considered good, while >5 signifies poor sleep quality (Agarg\u00fcn et al., 1996) . The administration time of the scale was about 5 min.",

The validity and reliability of the scale adapted to Turkish was tested by Aydemir, G\u00fcvenir, K\u00fcey, and K\u00fclt\u00fcr (1997) . After HADS was translated from its original language into Turkish, its translation equivalence was performed. In the second stage, its validity and reliability were tested on the university students. In the third stage, the scale was administered on 136 in-patients hospitalized in the Internal Disease department of a hospital. Its Cronbach's alpha coefficient was found as 0.85 for the anxiety sub-dimension and 0.78 for its depression counterpart (Aydemir et al., 1997) . In our study, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient of HADS was established as 0.90 for the anxiety sub-dimension and 0.91 for its depression counterpart. The scale is not employed to diagnose, but rather to define anxiety and depression in a short time and to identify the risk group. Despite the word \"hospital\" in its title, this scale can also be used in studies conducted in the pertaining field or in primary care research. In that regard, it is administered on individuals not afflicted with any physical disorders. In this scale with 14 items in total, odd numbers are designed to elicit the level of anxiety, while even numbers are intended to identify depression levels. This scale is also made up of two subscales, called HADS-A (for anxiety) and HADS-D (for depression). The cut-off point is specified as 10 for the anxiety subscale, and 7 for depression. A score of 10 or more received in the anxiety sub-dimension imply that respondents are at risk for anxiety, while a score of 7 or more obtained from the depression sub-dimension indicates a risk for depression (Aydemir et al., 1997) . The administration of the scale took approximately 5 min.",

Prolonged sleep deprivation may be an underlying risk factor for both psychological and physiological disorders for healthcare staff (Inter-Agency Standing Committee, 2020). This personnel might be afflicted with some psychological disorders, including anxiety, depression and insomnia . Indeed, there is mounting clinical evidence suggesting that these workers tend to experience mental health burden in this process, which might have adverse psychological implications in the long run (Kang et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Xiao, Zhang, Kong, Li, & Yang, 2020) . In that regard, our results seem to confirm earlier findings in the literature. However, in contrast to previous reports, our participants' anxiety levels were not found at risk. This discrepancy could be partly attributed to the fact that workers (260 respondents), such as cleaning staff and office personnel, who were in short-term contact with patients outnumbered those (175 respondents) in prolonged contact with patients, such as doctors, nurses, paramedics, and medical secretaries.",

Contrary to this study, published clinical research indicates that individuals tend to be at more increased risk for mental health problems as the age progresses. Several reasons can account for this association. For instance, as they get older, individuals are burdened with further family responsibilities, which might impair their psychological well-being (Ennis & Bunting, 2013) . Moreover, higher risk of infection and illness with the advancement of age may enhance their anxiety levels (Umberson & Karas Montez, 2010) . As a counter-evidence for this information, previous research reports that anxiety levels decrease as the age of healthcare staff increase (Huang & Zhao, 2020) . When it comes to our study, higher anxiety levels in 21-32 age band may be because the younger group is mostly based at active units (emergency, intensive care, Covid-19 service), while the older group is charged in outpatient clinics and wards as part of the hospital policy. In addition, it can be assumed that gaining more experience along with the advancement of age can help experienced healthcare staff to address problematic issues more calmly, and hence anxiety levels may be higher among younger healthcare staff, who might not have sufficient experience to come up with effective solutions in the face of challenging conditions.",

While some diseases lead to larger amount of sleep, painful diseases accompanied by physical distress, frequent urination during the night, and respiratory distress experienced by people whose nasal passages are not fully open may degrade sleep quality. Psychological disorders also reduce both sleep duration and sleep quality (Kozier & Erb, 2016) . In this study, we observed that those who rated their health status as poor ended up with poor sleep quality overall. Indeed, poor health status accompanied by poor sleep quality is an expected result because knowing that the presence of a chronic disease may cause more severe progression in Covid-19 is likely to induce distress in individuals and thus deterioration of sleep quality. In our study, the anxiety and depression scores of the respondents who rated their health status as poor turned out to be high, but this did not yield a statistically significant result. A restless body and mind can be a considerable factor in sleeping and duration of staying asleep. Anxiety and depressive affect induced by job pressure, familial duties, and other stressors end up with difficulty in falling asleep or maintaining sleep. Those with underlying chronic diseases reportedly have higher levels of anxiety vulnerability, depression and sleep irregularities (Dong et al., 2020; Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Dosil-Santamaria, Picaza-Gorrochategui, & Idoiaga-Mondragon, 2020) . Consistent with the literature, our participants reporting a history of mental problems had anxiety and depression scores at risk levels as well as poor sleep quality. A broad spectrum of factors, ranging from job satisfaction, workload, and years of work experience affect anxiety, depression and sleep quality of healthcare staff (Enli Tuncay et al., 2020; Mir\u00f3, Solanes, Mart\u00ednez, & S\u00e1nchez, 2007) . Likewise, our respondents reporting job dissatisfaction had very poor sleep quality as well as anxiety and depression scores at the risk level, confirming previous research. In addition, though sleep quality remained low in those with work experience of 1 to 5 years, no significant difference was identified in anxiety and depression scores in relation to years of work experience.",

Sleep quality can be described as feeling fit, refreshed and ready for the new day after waking up. Anxiety and sleep quality interact with each other within a vicious circle. On the one hand, working in rotational shifts and under harsh conditions can impair sleep cycle and quality of healthcare staff, increasing their vulnerability to anxiety and depression. On the other hand, it is well-documented that anxious state can also affect their sleep quality because anxious individuals experience frequent sleep interruptions and often have difficulty falling asleep (Alvaro et al., 2013; Chou, Chang, & Chung, 2015; Johnson, Roth, & Breslau, 2006; \u00d6 zt\u00fcrk & Ulu\u015fahin, 2018; Xiao et al., 2020) . We noted a positive correlation between anxiety and depression levels of healthcare staff and their sleep quality, which also accords with earlier studies reporting similar observations.",

            "text": "This study set out to reveal the impact of Covid-19 process on sleep quality, anxiety and depression state of frontline healthcare staff at a tertiary-level hospital. Taken together, the evidence from our findings implies that their sleep quality remains poor, and their depression levels, but not their anxiety levels, are in jeopardy. Besides, some descriptive characteristics exert a noticeable influence on their anxiety state, risk of depression and sleep quality. Another major finding emerging from our study is the presence of a positive relationship between anxiety and depression levels and sleep quality. All these findings might have important implications for unraveling the current psychological and psychosocial state of first-line healthcare staff during the pandemic process, and based on these results, we suggest several courses of action to minimize this problem. For instance, regular online meetings can be held on a weekly basis during the pandemic process in order to take heed of their emotions and thoughts in addition to providing the necessary medical information. Online psychoeducation programs can also be organized weekly to offer psychological support. The healthcare staff based at active units and those working in less active units could be included in the rotation at fixed intervals. They should be screened regularly to identify their anxiety and depression levels and sleep disorders. Furthermore, it is of great importance to establish multidisciplinary mental health teams (psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists) in hospitals in terms of assisting this personnel. Finally, providing required information about the health care of patients diagnosed with Covid-19, assigning sufficient number of personnel, catering for basic needs (food and fluid intake), supplying adequate personal protective equipment, and establishing resting areas can reduce the susceptibility of first-line healthcare staff to anxiety and depression and improve their overall sleep quality.",
