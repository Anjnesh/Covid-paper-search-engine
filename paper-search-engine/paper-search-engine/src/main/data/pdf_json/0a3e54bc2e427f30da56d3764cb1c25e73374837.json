Most participants found it acceptable to complete the assessment once a week, on a weekday, while a few were willing to complete it after each sexual encounter. It was suggested that a message reminder to complete the assessment should be sent at least daily until it is completed. The majority agreed that a password-protected application with a discreet logo was ideal for privacy, ease of use and flexibility for completion in any setting.

In the absence of a biological marker to identify actual HIV exposure, retrospective self-reported risky sexual behavior is usually used as a proxy of potential exposure to infection. Self-report data collection methods include face-toface interviewing, daily diaries, computer-assisted self-interviews (CASI) and audio computer-assisted self-interviews (ACASI). However, none of these have been identified as a gold standard for data collection of sexual activity (6) (7) (8) .",

Measurement error related to selfreport is common, due to social desirability response bias and recall error (10) (11) (12) (13) given long recall periods and the challenges associated with capturing complex patterns of sexual activity (14) (15) (16) (17) . Interviewer-administered in-clinic assessments are often time-consuming, resulting in response fatigue by interviewers and participants, which may prompt some researchers to utilize ACASI. However, ACASI may be problematic as it is initially expensive to purchase the equipment and is only cost-effective if it is used for studies with large sample sizes or across many different studies (18) . Participants also need to be able to use the software. Many of these challenges may be mitigated with a brief, mobile phone assessment, completed daily or prompted through sexual activity. This method may improve the validity and reliability of self-reported sexual behavior as it allows for more anonymous, remote (away from the clinic) real-time reporting.",

            "text": "Mobile phone use is ubiquitous (19, 20) but it is unknown whether smartphones with internet and application (app) capacity are as ubiquitous in settings like Soweto, South Africa. At least two thirds of the general SA population have access to a mobile phone (21, 22) . Mobile phone interventions have been shown to be feasible tools in HIV prevention trials in SA, especially among at-risk populations (23, 24) . In a study conducted by Dietrich et al. (23) , 50 adult women in Soweto, South Africa completed daily mobile phone questionnaires over 12 weeks and showed an overall response rate of 82%. The study also showed that self-report of vaginal sexual intercourse was significantly higher through the mobile phone surveys than the in-clinic questionnaires. Overall, the study showed that collecting sexual behavioral data via mobile phone is feasible. Another study conducted in Kenya by Curran et al. (24) used a short message service (SMS) method to set up surveys to collect data on sexual behavior and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence. Ninety-six HIV uninfected adults took PrEP daily and responded to SMS surveys for 60 days. Overall, 94% of surveys were successfully answered, which showed a high response rate and that using a mobile phone based survey method to collect sensitive sexual health and behavior information is feasible and acceptable. There are certainly few published data within the area of implementing remote data collection within South African HIV prevention research. Even fewer studies engage potential users in the design and development of health applications. We address this gap of user engagement through obtaining user feedback which are to be used to optimize the app for future implementation. Therefore, we conducted a qualitative study to determine mobile phone use among adults aged 18-39 years seeking HIV counseling and testing at a community outreach clinic, as well as to explore their perspectives on how to improve upon an existing mobile phone sexual risk assessment. The current study extends the work of HVTN 915 by obtaining user recommendations on the mobile phone assessment used in the HVTN 915 prospective cohort study of 50 adult women 18-25 years in Soweto, South Africa who were followed up for 12 weeks (23, 25) . Participants of HVTN 915 were provided with internet-enabled smartphones to complete surveys consisting of five daily sexual behavior questions via SurveyCTO, an independent mobile phone app. SurveyCTO was pre-loaded on the mobile device prior to providing the phone to the participant. Participants also completed eight interviewer-administered inclinic behavioral risk questionnaires during the study. In addition, vaginal swabs were self-collected daily and used to assess occurrence of unprotected sex and possible exposure to HIV through detection of Y chromosome and HIV, respectively. Results from a comparison of mobile phone assessments to inclinic questionnaires are reported in more detail elsewhere (23, 25) . Briefly, sex acts reported via the mobile phone app were more accurate than via the in-clinic questionnaire (25) , suggesting that daily mobile phone surveys reduced the social desirability and recall biases on in-clinic administered questionnaires. In addition, the results showed high adherence to the daily mobile phone survey completion with an 82% response rate of 4219 delivered surveys (23) . A limitation of the HVTN 915 design was that the sample did not include men and people older than 25 years and was therefore not representative of current HIV prevention trial target populations (26, 27) . For the present study we obtained user recommendations among 19-39-yearold men and women to optimize the HVTN 915 mobile phone sexual risk assessment for use in HIV vaccine prevention trials. We facilitated discussions with the participants in which we explored preferences for format, language, frequency of survey completion, frequency and timing of reminders and incentives for the completion of the mobile phone survey. Additionally, we explored facilitators and barriers to mobile phone surveys.",

Our study team were able to approach participants in-person, if they were still at the clinic or telephonically to provide a brief overview of the study and to establish initial interest. Those that expressed interest were invited to return to the clinic for the scheduled FGD. The FGD was conducted at a private room at the PHRU.

First, a coding framework using a table in Microsoft word was created according to questions in the FGD guide. The first FGD transcript was coded using a line-by-line analysis to assign text to codes allowing unexpected codes to emerge. The first author reviewed the codebook and addressed discrepancies. Emerging codes were added to the coding framework to create a codebook. The codes and transcripts were then imported into Nvivo (QSR International Pty Ltd. Version 12. 2018). The next three FGDs were coded in Nvivo using axial coding. Once coding was complete, codes were examined to identify patterns, common concepts and emerging ideas. Identified patterns and concepts were grouped according to categories to develop themes. To reduce subjectivity in the coding and analysis process, final interpretation was conducted. Access to and use of mobile phones were examined to inform the development and optimization of a mobile phone sexual risk assessment that could be integrated into the participant's daily mobile phone practices. Next, key recommendations for optimizing a mobile sexual risk assessment were explored, followed by facilitators and barriers to using this assessment.",

In general, participants preferred a discrete and private password protected application with up to 10 simply worded sentences that could be offered in a range of South African languages. In the context of long-term HIV vaccine trials, participants suggested that mobile phone surveys should be completed weekly or soon after sexual activity with discrete message reminders to prompt completion. If the mobile phone surveys are given weekly, participants would prefer to complete them on weekdays, however, a study done in women with sexually transmitted diseases found that their sexual activity peaked on Fridays and Saturdays (36) and a literature review found that in some populations, HIV risk behavior had weekend patterns (37) . This disconnect between what participants want and when they engage in sexual activity may lead to inaccurate information from the mobile phone survey due to recall bias. If the survey is sent early on in the week this could mitigate the potential issue. These practical recommendations are valuable considerations for those designing mobile health technologies targeted to sexual risk assessments.",

            "text": "Participants reported barriers to completing mobile phone surveys that need to be mitigated. Response fatigue to survey completion over years is one of them. HIV prevention trials are usually conducted over a long period of time and participants were concerned that completing the mobile phone survey frequently could become tiresome and lead to lower completion rates and possible attrition, which decreases the sample size and therefore power of HIV prevention trials and may introduce bias (40) . There were similar findings in studies conducted by Dietrich et al. (23) and Curran et al. (24) where response rates to mobile phone surveys decreased in the later stages of the trials. Incentives and reminders are two methods that have been used to reduce this problem. Another creative solution that emerged was to introduce an element of variation into both the content and wording of the mobile phone surveys and reminders to keep the process interesting, thus potentially reducing the response fatigue. However, asking questions differently will prevent investigators from monitoring responses over time, as differently worded questions may lead to different understanding and potentially different answers (41, 42) . In addition, incentives could be increased over the study period to support survey completion. The monetary and time costs of completing the mobile phone survey are important barriers that need to be addressed. A pilot study done by Mngadi et al. investigating feasibility and acceptability of using USSD to assess reactogenicity symptoms in a HIV vaccine trial ensured that all costs of the tool were directly charged to the research site and that participants would be able to access the tool even if they did not have airtime (43) . This method of removing any monetary costs to the participant could be an effective way of reducing this barrier. If an SMS system is used, an effective way to minimize the monetary cost is to ensure that all the survey answers are transmitted in a single SMS as opposed to one SMS per answer. In order to mitigate the time cost, mobile phone surveys should be kept short and ensure that the format is compatible with completion in any setting.",

In terms of practical implications, findings from this study will be used to optimize our existing application-based mobile phone sexual risk assessments. This method of obtaining remote sexual risk data from trial participants is of particular relevance in the present context of COVID-19 physical distancing. Further research is needed to determine how men in South Africa would adhere to completing mobile phone sexual risk assessments. Further, the literacy levels and technology use of older groups in South Africa may be different to the young women who participated in HVTN 915. Therefore, further investigation could provide data on the acceptability and feasibility of conducting mobile phone sexual risk assessments in older South Africans.",
