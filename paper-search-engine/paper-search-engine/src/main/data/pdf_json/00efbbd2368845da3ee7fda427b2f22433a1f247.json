The data for this study were gathered from questionnaires of 363 consumers from eight farmers' markets in seven districts of Izmir province, Turkey. To reveal the consumer profile of the farmers' markets examined in this study, consumer segments were determined using factor and cluster analysis. Two different consumer segments -'conventional' and 'conscious'-were identified in the farmers' markets examined. 'Conventional Consumers' reflect typical consumer behaviours and give more importance to factors such as the location of and access to the market, quality and freshness of the products, activities at and around the market and the availability and variety of products. 'Conscious Consumers', in contrast, represent a group that is more sensitive about food safety. The majority of consumers (63.64%) who visited farmers' markets were from the Conscious Consumer segment. The majority of the consumers who visit farmers' markets are conscious consumers, requiring the strategies related to these markets to be revised. Farmers' markets should be improved in terms of selecting vendors, food safety, physical facilities and social activities.",

            "text": "Farmers' markets-indoor or outdoor marketplaces where producers sell the products they produce directly to consumers-are one of the most common options for direct marketing. A farmers' market is defined as a common area wherein producers sell fresh fruits and vegetables as well as other agricultural products directly to consumers at separate stands [1] . Farmers' markets are one of the activities in alternative food networks. In many developed countries, farmers' markets develop for numerous reasons, such as enabling an increase in farmer income, benefiting consumers by providing fresh, high-quality products and facilitating communication and social interaction with local communities [2] . Farmers' markets are viewed as an opportunity to support small farmers, promote direct communication between consumers and producers, ease access to local, healthy products, support local economies and offer consumers an alternative to industrial food products [3] . Important factors such as an increase in consumer demand for fresh and locally grown products, changes in the agricultural economy, A face-to-face survey was conducted with customers at eight farmers' markets in the Izmir province of Turkey to determine the factors motivating consumers to shop at farmers' markets. Knowing the motivating factors, consumer segments, consumer preferences and expectations that attract consumers to farmers' markets can significantly benefit the producers in these markets as well as those who manage them. Thus, those who manage farmers' markets can ensure that consumer demands are met more effectively. This might lead to an increase in the number of consumers patronising existing farmers' markets and an increase in the demand for new farmers' markets. In this way, local administrators will have an opportunity to provide economic benefits to their region, support local agricultural producers and offer healthy and high-quality food to consumers. Simultaneously, local administrators can establish more fluent relationships with consumers by learning their opinions about the producers and marketrelated subjects (i.e. products, activities, etc.). Additionally, local managers having access to consumer profiles of those who patronise farmers' markets will enable them to better plan the locations of possible farmers' markets in the future.",

The fact that the number of consumers shopping at farmers' markets, or the main audience, was not fully known made this method effective. Nakip [31] stated that the estimation of the sample volume in marketing research can be done using ratios. According to Nakip [31] , the biggest advantage of determining the sample volume using ratios is calculating the sample volume without the need for standard deviations. The sample volume formula (1) according to this method is as follows:",

While the calculated sample volume was distributed according to the farmers' markets in the identified districts, the number of producers, size of the market area and shopping volume (based on observation) were taken as the base. Within this framework, the plan was to interview 30 people or less at small-scale farmers' markets, 31-49 people at medium-scale markets and at least 50 people or more at large-scale farmers' markets. Considering the sample volume and the criteria determined for the field study, 384 surveys of consumers were conducted. However, 21 of these surveys wherein the researchers were given incomplete information and data reliability was suspected were not included in the data analysis. In this context, a total of 363 surveys were considered for data analysis of eight farmers' markets. Accordingly, the distribution of 363 consumer surveys at local farmers' markets in the districts is as follows: Alia\u011fa (15), Bergama (31) , Bornova (65), \u00c7 e\u015fme (53), Fo\u00e7a (41), Seferihisar-Merkez (64), Seferihisar-S\u0131\u011fac\u0131k (45) and Urla (49). The survey was conducted in September and October of 2016 and interviews with consumers were performed at farmers' markets. Great care was taken to ensure that the consumers participating in the survey were individuals who were interested in farmers' markets and had previously visited these markets in order to increase the reliability of the answers.",

The median [40] . After a general evaluation of this data, we can determine that farmers' markets draw a middle-income group profile. The average annual household net income was between US$7,951 and 19,868, considering the segment comprised about half (49.31%) of the consumers visiting the analysed farmers' markets. Wolf and Berrenson [27] found that 41% of consumers had an annual income of less than US $20,000. In their study in the US, Ruelas et al. [37] , however, stated that 55% of consumers earned less than US$15,000 per year. In many studies conducted in the US, the net annual household income of the consumers visiting farmers' markets was higher than that of Turkey. The net annual household in-come found by Govindasamy et al. [6] was US$60,000, by Henneberry et al. [4] was US$40,000-60,000, by Conner et al. [12] was US$56,000 and by Wilson et al.

This study confirms the hypothesis that the factors that motivate consumers to shop at farmers' markets vary according to consumer segment. Two consumer segments-Conventional Consumers and Conscious Consumers-were determined in the examined farmers' markets. Conventional consumers reflect the behaviour of typical consumers on a basic level, whereas conscious consumers represent a group that is more sensitive about food safety. According to the findings of this study, the majority of consumers (63.64%) who vis-ited farmers' markets were from the Conscious Consumer segment. This makes it necessary to manage farmers' markets more effectively. Conscious consumers represent the group most loyal to farmers' markets. The most important motivating factor that brings conscious consumers to farmers' markets is food safety concerns. Even if they know that they cannot find certificated products produced with organic or good agricultural methods at farmers' markets, consumers assume that the products offered for sale are grown using less chemicals. Conscious consumers believe that the vendors at farmers' markets are controlled by the relevant local municipalities; therefore, healthier products are offered in these markets. However, how healthy the products sold by farmers' markets vendors actually are in terms of food safety is controversial. Although farmers' markets operate under the control of local municipalities, there are many deficiencies. Most importantly, the vendors selected to sell at farmers' markets are not chosen carefully. Local municipalities should evaluate vendors in terms of different criteria, especially the suitability for healthy production conditions, when choosing the vendors for farmers' markets. Doubts regarding how healthy the products offered in farmers' markets are can never be eliminated without implementing a certification system. In this context, it should be obligatory to obtain certification for products offered for sale directly by vendors at farmers' markets. The findings obtained from the interviewed consumers revealed that there are other important problems to be resolved in farmers' markets. First, the physical structure of farmers' markets should be improved and these markets should be made more visual. Additionally, it is crucial to make the farmers' markets an entertaining environment featuring social activities such as events, concerts and festivals.",
