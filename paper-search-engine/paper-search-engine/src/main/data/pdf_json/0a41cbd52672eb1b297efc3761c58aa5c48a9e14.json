The report also showed that in 2018, there were an estimated 405,000 deaths from malaria globally, compared with 416,000 estimated deaths in 2017, and 585,000 in 2010 (WHO, 2019) . Majority (94%) of these deaths occurred in the African region (WHO, 2019) . While malaria prevalence and mortality has declined over the years, recent reports suggest that these gains may stand the risk of being reversed, particularly with the threat of resistance to ACTs spreading from Southeast Asia to Africa (Ashley et al., 2014) . There is therefore the need to intensify efforts at developing effective treatment regimens that can treat multi-drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria.",

            "text": "The Tracking Resistance to Artemisinin Collaboration II (TRACII) trial was established to conduct a randomized clinical trial mainly in Asia to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two triple ACTs (TACTs) with corresponding ACT (van der Pluijm et al., 2020) . This TRACII trial involved combining existing antimalarial: AL with amodiaquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) with mefloquine, both of which were able to treat multi-drug resistant falciparum malaria. Taking the results to the next level, the overarching goal of the Development of Triple Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (DeTACT) project is to have co-formulated TACTs ready for global deployment once they are found to be non-inferior to ACTs in the treatment of malaria. This has implications. As with the introduction of any new health interventions, there is the need, not only to address issues related to efficacy and safety, but also to anticipate ethical, social and regulatory aspects of deploying TACTs. Ethical questions may arise around deployment of TACTs in contexts where ACTs remain effective, such as in Africa. Effective implementation of updated treatment policies and integrating ACTs into established market structures in Africa has historically faced several ethical, social and regulatory challenges (Maslove et al., 2009; Mutero et al., 2014; Wasunna et al., 2008; Yeung & White, 2005) . A review article by Amin et al. reported that it took nearly 3 years for Kenya to implement ACT after the policy change was announced (Amin et al., 2007) . Similar implementation delays were observed by Bosman and Mendis in several malaria endemic countries (Bosman & Mendis, 2007) . Beyond delays in implementation programs, many factors were associated with a problematic market introduction of ACTs in Africa. These vary from high consumer prices and suboptimal integration in distribution chains, to a lack of end-user acceptability through factors such as negative community perceptions and perceived side effects (Arrow et al., 2004; Malik et al., 2006; Martins et al., 2012; Palafox et al., 2014; Yadav et al., 2007) . Similar challenges are also likely to affect the future deployment of new antimalarials on the African continent. Additionally, introduction of previous generations of antimalarial drugs warrant a market positioning assessment to address issues related to changing treatment policy and the integration of TACTs into established market structures. Therefore, it is important to learn lessons from the past and anticipate ethical, regulatory and market related issues for the introduction and deployment of new generations of antimalarials.",

            "text": "There are several lessons that can be learned from country experiences in the adoption and deployment of ACTs in Africa which can inform the rapid deployment of TACTs in Africa. Developing effective communication strategies to sensitize communities about the change in treatment policies is clearly important and has played a major role in malaria treatment policy implementation in several countries (Mutero et al., 2014) . Public involvement (which includes taking into account stakeholders' views needs to be harnessed right from the time of undertaking the research through to implementing the national treatment policies. Innovative drugs should also be aligned with the prevalent institutional frameworks and there should be effective strategies in place to phase out previous drug generations from the market (Martins et al., 2012) . Even though the WHO recommended the deployment of ACTs in areas of drug resistance since 2001, non-artemisinin therapies continued to dominate the drug markets in African countries beyond 2009 (Palafox et al., 2014 . Beyond influencing policy change, there are other barriers to effective treatment of malaria that need to be addressed. Chuma et al. have reported that issues related to affordability, acceptability and availability interact to influence access to prompt and effective treatment (Chuma et al., 2010) . Other issues that have been highlighted in the literature include community acceptance, adherence to treatment guidelines both at the facility and household level, prescribers' preferences and the burden on health systems (Ajayi et al., 2008; Bosman & Mendis, 2007; O'Connell et al., 2011) . Inertia in the process of policy implementation, misalignment with institutional arrangements and complexity of distribution chains have also been associated with the slow uptake of innovative drugs (Martins et al., 2012; Palafox et al., 2014; Yadav et al., 2007) . Ajayi et al., 2008; Williams et al., 2004) . Addressing these issues is important to determine if TACTs will be accepted once they are proven safe and non-inferior to ACTs in African settings.",

The study looks ahead at the ethical, social, regulatory and market position issues in readiness for the potential deployment of TACTs in Africa. The study comprises two main research questions on the ethical and market positioning around the deployment of TACTs. It is a qualitative study design using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions targeting key stakeholders in Burkina Faso and Nigeria.Contribution, significance and novelty The protocol provides a useful opportunity for other researchers to feedback, and use to carry out similar studies.",
