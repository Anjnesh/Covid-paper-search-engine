Structurally disparate compounds have been reported as M pro inhibitors, 42 raising the question of their target specificity. To elucidate the target specificity and the 43 cellular target engagement of the claimed M pro inhibitors, we systematically characterize 44 their mechanism of action using the cell-free FRET assay, the thermal shift-binding 45 assay, the cell lysate Protease-Glo luciferase assay, and the cell-based Flip-GFP 46 assay. Collectively, our results have shown that majority of the M pro inhibitors identified 47 from drug repurposing including ebselen, carmofur, disulfiram, and shikonin are 48 promiscuous cysteine inhibitors that are not specific to M pro , while chloroquine, 49 oxytetracycline, montelukast, candesartan, and dipyridamole do not inhibit M pro in any of 50 the assays tested. Overall, our study highlights the need of stringent hit validation at the 51 early stage of drug discovery.",

These results contradict to the potent antiviral activity of both 293 compounds in Vero E6 cells 2 . It is noted that calpain inhibitors II and XII are also potent 294 inhibitors of cathepsin L with IC50 values of 0.41 and 1.62 nM, respectively 3 . One possible 295 explanation is that the antiviral activity of calpain inhibitors II and XII against SARS-CoV-2 might 296 be cell type dependent, and the observed inhibition in Vero E6 cells might be due to cathepsin L 297 inhibition instead of M pro inhibition. Vero E6 cells are TMPRSS2 negative, and SARS-CoV-2 298 enters cell mainly through endocytosis and is susceptible to cathepsin L inhibitors 52 . To further 299 evaluate the antiviral activity of calpain inhibitors II and XII against SARS-CoV-2, we tested 300 them in Calu-3 cells using the immunofluorescence assay (Fig. 4G , K, L). Calu-3 is TMPRSS2 301 positive and it is a close mimetic of the human primary epithelial cell 53 . As expected, calpain 302 inhibitors II and XII displayed much weaker antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells 303 than in Vero E6 cells with EC50 values of 30.34 and 14.78 \u00b5M, respectively (Fig. 4K, L) . These 304 results suggest that the Flip-GFP assay can be used to faithfully predict the antiviral activity of 305 M pro inhibitors. The lower activity of calpain inhibitors II and XII in the Flip-GFP assay and the 306 Calu-3 antiviral assay might due to the competition with host proteases, resulting in the lack of 307 cellular target engagement with M pro . 308",

HIV protease inhibitors 209 HIV protease inhibitors, especially Kaletra, have been hotly pursued as potential COVID-19 210 treatment at the beginning of the pandemic. Kaletra was first tested in clinical trial during the 211 SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003 and showed somewhat promising results based on the limited 212 data 45 . However, a double-blinded, randomized trial concluded that Kaletra was not effective in 213 treating severe COVID-19 46, 47 . In SARS-CoV-2 infection ferret models, Kaletra showed marginal 214 effect in reducing clinical symptoms, while had no effect on virus titers 48 . 215 Keletra is a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir. Lopinavir is a HIV protease inhibitor, and 216 ritonavir is used as a booster. Ritonavir does not inhibit the HIV protease and it is a cytochrome 217 P450-3A4 inhibitor 49 . When used in combination, ritonavir can enhance other protease inhibitors 218 by preventing or slowing down the metabolism. In cell culture, lopinavir was reported to inhibit 219 the nanoluciferase SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus with an EC50 of 9 \u00b5M 17 . In two other studies, 220 lopinavir showed moderate antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 activity with EC50 values of 221 19 \u00b1 8 \u00b5M 28 and 25 \u00b5M 29 . As such, it was assumed that lopinavir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 through 222 inhibiting the M pro . However, lopinavir showed no activity against SARS-CoV-2 M pro in the FRET 223 assay from our previous study (IC50 > 60 \u00b5M) 2 . Wong et al also showed that lopinavir was a 224 weak inhibitor against SARS-CoV M pro with an IC50 of 50 \u00b5M 50 . In the current study, we further 225 confirmed the lack of binding of lopinavir to SARS-CoV-2 M pro in the thermal shift assay (\u0394Tm = -226 0.60 o C) (Table 2). The result from the Flip-GFP assay was not conclusive as lopinavir was 227 cytotoxic. Lopinavir was not active in the Protease-Glo luciferase assay. Taken together, 228 lopinavir is not a M pro inhibitor. 229We also tested additional HIV antivirals including ritonavir, atazanavir, nelfinavir, and 230 cobicistat. Atazanavir and nelfinavir were reported as a potent SARS-CoV-2 antiviral with EC50 231 values of 2.0 \u00b1 0.12 32 and 0.77 \u00b5M 17 using the infectious SARS-CoV-2 and the nanoluciferase 232 13 reporter virus (SARS-CoV-2-Nluc), respectively. A drug repurposing screening similar identified 233 nelfinavir as a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral with an IC50 of 3.3 \u00b5M 24 . Sharma et al showed that 234",

Similarly, ebselen 319 also non-specifically inhibited several other viral cysteine proteases in the absence of DTT 320 including SARS-CoV-2 PL pro , EV-D68 2A pro and 3C pro , and EV-A71 2A pro and 3C pro35 . The 321 inhibition was abolished with the addition of DTT. Ebselen also had no antiviral activity against 322 EV-A71 and EV-D68, suggesting that the FRET assay results without reducing reagent cannot 323 be used to predict the antiviral activity. In this study, we found that ebselen showed no inhibition 324 in either the Flip-GFP assay or the split-luciferase assay (Fig. 4A, E, I), providing further 325 evidence for the promiscuous mechanism of action of ebselen. Another independent study by 326 Deval et al using mass spectrometry assay reached similar conclusion that the inhibition of M pro 327 by ebselen is non-specific and inhibition was abolished with the addition of reducing reagent 328 DTT or glutathione 54 . In contrary to the potent antiviral activity reported by Yang et al, the study 329 from Deval et al found that ebselen was inactive against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells (EC50 > 330 100 \u00b5M). Lim et al reported that ebselen and disulfiram had synergistic antiviral effect with 331 remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 in vero E6 cells 55 . It was proposed that ebselen and disulfiram 332 act as zinc ejectors and inhibited not only the PL pro56 , but also the nsp13 ATPase and nsp14 333 exoribonuclease activities 55 , further casting doubt on the detailed mechanism of action of 334 ebselen. 335 Despite the accumulating evidence to support the promiscuous mechanism of action of 336 ebselen, several studies continue to explore ebselen and its analogs as SARS-CoV-2 M pro and 337 PL pro inhibitors 36, 57, 58 . A number of ebselen analogs were designed and found to have 338 comparable enzymatic inhibition and antiviral activity as ebselen. MR6-31-2 had slightly weaker 339 enzymatic inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 M pro compared to ebselen (IC50 = 0.824 vs 0.67 \u00b5M), 340 however, MR6-31-2 had more potent antiviral activity than ebselen (EC50 = 1.78 vs 4.67 \u00b5M) 341 against SARS-CoV-2 M pro in Vero E6 cells.

Both 362 compounds showed no inhibition in either the Flip-GFP or the Protease-Glo luciferase assay 363 (Fig. 5A, F, G, R, S), suggesting they are not M pro inhibitors. These two compounds were 364 previously reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 M pro in the FRET assay 8 and had antiviral activity 365 against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. However, our recent study showed that shikonin had no 366 inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 M pro in the FRET assay in the presence of DTT 35 . Studies from 367 Deval et al using FRET assay and mass spectrometry assay reached the same conclusion. X-368 ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro in complex with Shikonin showed that shikonin binds 369 to the active site in a non-covalent manner. 9 370 In addition to the proposed mechanism of action of M pro inhibition, Schinazi et al showed 371 that baicalein and baicalin inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 62 . Overall, 372 shikonin and baicalein are not M pro inhibitors and the antiviral activity of baicalein against SARS-373 CoV-2 might involve other mechanisms. 374 20 A recent study from Luo et al identified several known drugs as SARS-\u00b5M). The discovery of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as M pro inhibitor was 380 particularly intriguing. Several high-throughput screenings have been conducted for M pro24, 64 , 381 and chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were not among the list of active hits. In our follow up 382 study, we found that none of the identified hits reported by Luo et al inhibited M pro either with or 383 without DTT in the FRET assay 30 . In corroborate with our previous finding, the Flip-GFP and 384 Protease-Glo luciferase assays similarly confirmed the lack of inhibition of these compounds 385 against M pro (Fig. 5A, H-M, T-Y). Therefore, it can be concluded that chloroquine, 386 hydroxychloroquine, oxytetracycline, montelukast, candesartan, and dipyridamole are not 387 SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors. Other than the claims made by Luo et al, no other studies have 388independently confirmed these compounds as M pro inhibitors.

Researchers around 413 the world are racing to share their findings with the scientific community to expedite the drug 414 discovery process. However, the quality of science should not be compromised by the speed. 415The mechanism of action of drug candidates should be thoroughly characterized in biochemical, 416 binding, and cellular assays. Pharmacological characterization should address both target 417 specificity and cellular target engagement. For target specificity, the drug candidates can be 418 counter screened against unrelated cysteine proteases such as the viral EV-A71 2A pro , EV-D68 419 2A pro , the host cathepsins B, L, and K, caspase, calpains I, II, and III, and etc. Compounds 420 inhibit multiple cysteine proteases non-discriminately are most likely promiscuous compounds 421 that act through redox cycling, inducing protein aggregation, or alkylating catalytic cysteine 422 residue C145. For cellular target engagement, the Flip-GFP and Protease-Glo luciferase assays 423 can be applied. Both assays are performed in the presence of competing host proteins at the 424 cellular environment. Collectively, our study reaches the following conclusions: 1) for validated 425 M pro inhibitors, the IC50 values with and without reducing reagent should be about the same in 426 24 the FRET assay; 2) validated M pro inhibitors should show consistent results in the FRET assay, 427 thermal shift binding assay, and the Protease-Glo luciferase assay. For compounds that are not 428 cytotoxic, they should also be active in the Flip-GFP assay; 3) compounds that have antiviral 429 activity but lack consistent results from the FRET, thermal shift, Flip-GFP, and Protease-Glo 430 luciferase assays should not be classified as M pro inhibitors; 4) compounds that non-specifically 431 inhibit multiple unrelated viral or host cysteine proteases are most likely promiscuous inhibitors 432 that should be triaged. 5) X-ray crystal structures cannot be used to justify the target specificity 433 or cellular target engagement. Promiscuous compounds have been frequently co-crystallized 434 with M pro including ebselen, carmofur, and shikonin (Table 2) . 435Overall, we hope our studies will promote the awareness of the promiscuous SARS-CoV-2 436 M pro inhibitors and call for more stringent hit validation. 437 438",
