We included patients > 18 and < 75 years old. According to the WHO Interim Guidance we categorized severity of illness as SARS-CoV-2 mild Pneumonia, Severe Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) . All the patients performed a static pulmonary function test (PFT), cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), and exercise test combined with echocardiography on the same day, six months after the first SARS-CoV-2 positive smear. Rest and peak exercise echocardiography were carried out at the same time of cardiopulmonary exercise test. Echocardiography was performed according to the European/American Society of echocardiography guidelines, CPET was performed using a microprocessor-controlled eddy current brake ergometer . Patients wore a non-rebreathing Hans-Rudolph Mask connected to Vyntus\u2122 CPX Metabolic Cart. All the patients completed after 3 minutes of unloaded warm-up phase a symptoms limited exercise test with a 10/W/min ramp protocol. Patients were encouraged to exercise up to the maximal effort. Oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry and heart rate with 12 lead ECG monitoring was performed during the test. Measurements of mixed expired oxygen, mixed expired carbon dioxide and expired volume were determined at rest and for each breath throughout exercise. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the study was approved by the ethics committee of our institution (CHUNSC_2020_50). The normality of the data distribution was determined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Parametric unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney U was used to evaluate the difference between two groups for continuous variables. Comparison between the three groups was performed with ANOVA test for continuous variables. Chi-squared test was used for categorical variables. All comparisons were made using two-tailed tests, and the level of significance was set at p < 0.05. All statistical tests were performed using the open-access statistical package the jamovi project (2021). jamovi (Version 1.6) [Computer Software].",

This subgroup of patients showed a similar ventilatory response described by Baratto et al. [5] in a CPET study at the moment of hospital discharge of SARS-CoV-2 survivors and recently by Singh et al. [6] in patients without anemia or pulmonary disease after 11 months of infection. Baratto the absence of blood gas analysis for PaCO2 quantification during exercise, we only could hypothesize according to normal Vd/VT response of these patients that some SARS-CoV-2 survivors could persist with an enhanced chemoreflex sensitivity during follow-up. A normal or supernormal cardiac output argues against deconditioning as the main cause of impaired systemic oxygen extraction and according to Singh et al. [6] could suggest a shift in skeletal muscle fiber type and/or reduced aerobic enzyme activity. LV function is preserved in all patients during follow-up at rest and during exercise. A central cardiac mechanism that limits oxygen delivery is excluded, excepting 3 patients (7.3%), 2 of 3 patients with previous pulmonary disease, that presented RV dilatation and dysfunction. ARDs group patients presented significant dilatation of mid-ventricular linear dimensions compared to mild pneumonia group, reinforcing the hypothesis that RV dilatation is probably related to parenchymal and/or pulmonary vascular disease [1] . Diastolic dysfunction has been described as a possible acute SARS-CoV-2 cardiac damage [1] , despite in ARDs subgroup we observed a trend of shorter mitral inflow E wave deceleration time (190\u00b162 ms VS 254\u00b181 ms; P 0,063) and a higher LA mean volume (28,7 ml/m2 Vs. 19,5 ml/m2; P 0,006), this alteration could be secondary to higher prevalence of hypertension and older patients of this subgroup.",
