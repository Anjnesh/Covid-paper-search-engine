            "text": "Owing to the rapid transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, responsible of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , healthcare systems experienced major disruptions worldwide, including the temporary closure of medical practices, and cancellation or postponement of nonemergency and elective procedures [1, 2] . These have induced individuals to forgo healthcare in preventive medicine, chronic disease diagnosis and management, and emergency medicine, as reported in several countries [1, 3, 4] . In Switzerland, a study conducted among vulnerable outpatients in the Geneva University Hospitals in June 2020 indicated that 38.5% had renounced healthcare since the start of the pandemic. [5] . However, this study relied on patient populations, whereas data from the general population remains limited. One such study in the United States showed that 41% of adults forwent healthcare between March and mid-June 2020 [6] . To date, no study has reported on the prevalence of forgoing healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population of countries with universal healthcare coverage. This information is important to understand the extent to which the pandemic-related disruptions in the healthcare system may have impacted access to healthcare, particularly among vulnerable and socioeconomically underprivileged population groups. Indeed, forgoing or delaying healthcare may have health consequences [7] . For instance, forgoing healthcare for chronic and emergency conditions can lead to increased complications and costs [8, 9] ; while missing preventive care appointments, such as cancer screenings, can result in a delayed diagnosis and poorer prognosis [1] . In this paper, we used a population-based sample of the adult population living in Geneva, Switzerland to estimate the prevalence of forgoing healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess the effect of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological status, general health, and sociodemographic factors on the likelihood of forgoing healthcare.",

If the answer was \"yes\", a following multiple-choice question collected information about the type of forgone healthcare. Options included: surgery; general practitioner; specialist; medication; dental; screening; inpatient rehabilitation; outpatient rehabilitation; medical devices; health center care; home nursing care; and other, from which we created three extra categories: \"physiotherapy\", \"mental care\", and \"alternative care\", such as acupuncture or therapeutic massage. A third question collected information about the reason for forgoing healthcare: cancelled or postponed appointment by the healthcare provider due to the COVID-19 pandemic; fear of being infected when seeking healthcare; financial reasons; inability to go to the appointment because of quarantine, isolation, family or professional reasons; participant self-isolating due to possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure; and other, from which we created two more categories: \"conscious\", for participants postponing healthcare to avoid overloading healthcare facilities, and \"lethargy\" for participants delaying healthcare that is unwanted.

Since our study was conducted later into the pandemic, healthcare that was initially forgone may have been rescheduled, leading to fewer reports of forgone healthcare. This remains concerning as delayed healthcare can also lead to unfavorable health outcome [7, 9] . Additionally, unlike the United States, healthcare coverage in Switzerland is universal [14] , which may also explain part of this difference. As previously reported in Europe [1, 4] , we found that participants with an average or bad health, and those in a self-reported disadvantaged financial situation were more likely to forgo healthcare. Interestingly, around 5% of participants who renounced healthcare reported having renounced their healthcare appointments with the intention to prevent overburdening the system and to allow access for those with greater medical care needs. As this reason was not explicitly listed in the survey question but rather reported in the \"other\" option, the proportion of people choosing to forgo healthcare for altruistic reasons may be higher, especially concerning non-urgent healthcare. The most frequent type of forgone healthcare were dental, specialist, and general medicine, which reflects findings in the United States [3] . A study conducted before the pandemic among adults in Geneva found that 13.8% and 10.9% reported forgoing healthcare and dental care for economic reasons, respectively, which are a higher rate than in our sample [5, 15] . The discrepancy could be attributed to how our survey question was interpreted; it defined forgoing healthcare since the beginning of the pandemic, but participants who would have renounced healthcare regardless may have not felt concerned.",

The cross-sectional design is a limitation to our findings, as it prevented us from examining changes in forgoing healthcare patterns since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The baseline questionnaire also limited the scope of our analysis; we were unable to assess if forgone healthcare had any negative health impacts, nor make a distinction between renounced or delayed healthcare. Forgoing healthcare may have been underestimated in our study due to social desirability recall bias and because of the potential underrepresentation of underprivileged populations.",
