            "text": "Background: Optimal management of severe trauma patients with active hemorrhage relies on adequate initial resuscitation. Early administration of coagulation factors improves post-traumatic coagulation disorders, and fourfactor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) might be useful in this context. Our main hypothesis is that fourfactor PCC in addition to a massive transfusion protocol decreases blood product consumption at day 1 in severe trauma patients with major bleeding. Methods: This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel, controlled superiority trial. Eligible patients are trauma patients with major bleeding admitted to a French level-I trauma center. Patients randomized in the treatment arm receive 1 mL/kg (25 IU/ml of Factor IX/Kg) four-factor PCC within 1-h post-admission while patients randomized in the controlled group receive 1 mL/kg of saline solution 0.9% as a placebo. Treatments are given as soon as possible using syringe pumps (120 mL/h). The primary endpoint is the amount of blood products transfused in the first 24 h post-admission (including red blood cells, frozen fresh plasma, and platelets). The secondary endpoints are the amount of each blood product transfused in the first 24 h, time to achieve prothrombin time ratio < 1.5, time to hemostasis, number of thrombo-embolic events at 28 days, mortality at 24 h and 28 days, number of intensive care unit-free days, number of ventilator-free days, number of hospital-free days within the first 28 days, hospitalization status at day 28, Glasgow outcome scale extended for patients with brain lesions on initial cerebral imaging, and cost of each strategy at days 8 and 28. Inclusions have started in December 2017 and are expected to be complete by June 2021.",

Death occurs within the first 48 h among 87% of trauma patients with fatal outcome, and the first cause of death at 24 h is massive bleeding [2, 3] . Hemorrhagic shock is preventable with adequate strategies including early control of the active source of bleeding and an optimization of initial resuscitation called \"damage control resuscitation\" [4] . The concept of damage control resuscitation consists of a combination of early administration of blood products, control of post-traumatic coagulopathy, and a reduction of crystalloid infusion and maintaining permissive hypotension. This strategy aims at treating hypovolemia and coagulation disorders while avoiding dilution coagulopathy [4] . International guidelines for blood product administration recommend the transfusion of packed red blood cell (RBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as soon as possible with RBC/FFP ratio between 1:1 and 2: 1 [5, 6] .",

However, FFP administration may be delayed due to logistical reasons such as transport and immediate availability. The administration of four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) has emerged as an alternative to early administrate coagulation factors and is used to treat post-traumatic coagulopathy in diverse European countries [8, 9] . A strategy combining fibrinogen and four factor-PCC has decreased blood product consumption [8] . The reduction of blood product consumption is meaningful since blood transfusion is associated with post-traumatic infectious complications [10] and is a risk factor for multiple organ failure after severe trauma [11] . Recently, an open-label randomized controlled trial comparing a classic massive transfusion protocol to a tailored administration of procoagulant concentrates, including PCC and fibrinogen, also showed a decrease in RBC transfusion resulting in less patients requiring massive transfusion [12] . However, there is no randomized controlled double-blind study assessing the impact of PCC in addition to a classic massive transfusion protocol including fibrinogen administration and blood product transfusion with RBC and FFP [13] .",

Third, mortality after severe trauma is a complex process depending on hemorrhage but also on traumatic brain injury and pre-existing medical conditions, specifically in elderly patients [22] .

The study is carried out following Good Clinical Practices, the principles of the declaration of Helsinki and European legislation [31] . Because of selection criteria, some enrolled patients are unable to consent (e.g., unconsciousness, agitation, post-traumatic stress). Informed consent can be therefore obtained from patient's next of kin if present or consent is waived if no one is present at the time of enrolment, as authorized by French law in an emergency situation and approved by the ethics committee. This procedure was already used and authorized in a previous French study on trauma [15] .",
