Such measures are variably defined, but generally expand voluntary physical distancing measures through business, school, and workplace closures, restrictions on movement and social gatherings, and imposition of legal penalties for violations. Lockdowns must often remain in place for a period of months to avoid a rebound in disease transmission among susceptible individuals when controls are lifted [2] . Quantitative evaluations of the effectiveness of such measures in attenuating pandemic peaks are rapidly emerging [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

In particular, lockdowns raise ethical questions when movement is restricted in liberal democratic societies [5, 7, 8] .

This may exacerbate loneliness and depression and contribute to mental health-related morbidity and mortality [9] [10] [11] [12] . Mental health represents an urgent health concern, and suicide mortality represents the sixteenth most common cause of death in the Waterloo Region of Ontario, Canada [13] . The direct effects of lockdown can be expected to be exacerbated by the economic stresses of business closures, increasing unemployment, and recession [12] . As a result, lockdowns make additional community support for anxiety, mental illness, suicidality, alcoholism, substance abuse, and domestic violence an ethical imperative [10, 14] .",

Likewise, at least three international studies suggest substantially decreased use of mental health emergency services, with one indicating a dramatically decreased number of emergency psychiatric consultations in three French centres [16] , and two showing a marked decline in emergency psychiatric consultations [17] and admissions [18] during lockdown in Italy. On the other hand, European member states saw a 60% increase in emergency calls from women regarding intimate partner violence [19] .

The changepoint models found significant changes in mean and variance using the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) method [25] with a range of penalties between twice the log of the number of observations and 100 times the log of the number of observations. Diagnostic plots comparing the number of changepoints and the penalty values (see Supplementary Materials) were used to find the optimal number of changepoints. We tried to find the \"elbow\" of these plots, minimizing both the penalty value and the number of changepoints [26] . The locations of those changepoints and the means of each segment were then calculated. Models were created using the`cpt.meanvarf unction from the`changepoint`R package [27] . R (version 4.02) was used to calculate all tabulations and statistics. Code is available at https://github.com/ alechay/covid19-mh",

The visits were not significantly reduced, and alcoholrelated visits were reduced at a level that approached significance (Table 1) .

Total police responses and calls to the crisis line were also compared.

Crisis calls were significantly decreased during the initial period of lockdown compared to the same period in 2019. Suicide attempts were significantly decreased during the period of lockdown compared to a year before. Intoxications, assaults, and domestic disputes were not significantly different during the period of lockdown compared to a year before ( Table 2 ). Figure 4 shows the significant changes in mean and variance for daily ED visits, total weekly mental health diagnoses, total weekly crisis calls, and total weekly police responses from March 5 to September 5, 2020. There was a significant decrease in daily ED visits on March 20 and there were significant increases on April 29 and May 24, points close in time to the beginning of lockdown and the easing of restrictions. There was a significant increase in weekly mental health diagnoses starting in the week of July 12 -July 18. There was a significant increase in crisis calls starting in the week of May 31 -June 6, the same week that many guidelines, such as gathering restrictions, were eased. There was a significant increase in weekly police responses starting in the week of June 14 -June 20.",

First, the reduction in use of mental health services may be framed as a general reduction in hospital activities, although the concurrent reduction in police calls argues against this. There may also be a change in the threshold for involuntary admission, owing to physicians using their discretion to avoid inpatient treatment when possible. Second, the reduction in social gatherings and other opportunities for public drug and alcohol intoxication and mental health crises may have resulted in an actual reduction in the community burden of mental health morbidity. Previously public intoxications and mental health crises may have become private as a result of the closure of traditional social venues. Third, screening points limiting entry to healthcare facilities, migration of clinical care to virtual and outpatient visits, and media portrayals of overwhelmed healthcare settings may foster a perception that mental health visits are less of a priority during the pandemic [30] . In addition, there may also be a fear of contamination or infection [18] that diminishes the likelihood of the public to seek help through in-person channels, whether these be EDs or police departments.",
