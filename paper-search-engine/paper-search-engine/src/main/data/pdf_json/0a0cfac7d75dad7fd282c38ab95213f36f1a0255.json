In such a situation, for successful implementation, the policymakers need to understand the public acceptance of carpooling services based on its key motives and constraints. This research explores the key motives and constraints to the introduction scenarios of carpooling service in Islamabad. A stated preference questionnaire survey was conducted via Google Form comprising several parts relating to carpooling. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were processed, and a structural model was developed. Females (both single and married) were less orientated to carpool with males and married males with females. Unknown carpooling partners negatively influenced the factor of intention to shift to carpooling service. Our study provides policymakers and transport planners with an appropriate forecasting model of significant factors. In addition, it provides suggestions to transport planners to design promotional tools to enhance the tendency of carpooling among private car users in favor of reducing traffic congestion and increased car ownership rate in the city.",

This step got much success for short times, and the car manufacturers were affected very badly. So, they promoted their policies to a new and advanced level, which ultimately showed an almost 90% decline in carpools [3] .",

However, this situation becomes difficult to handle if the passenger needs to drop at some different locations. Another most complex form of this setup persists when the driver has to pick the passenger from some defined location and then again in the same trip needs to be dropped off at the originated location again. Such a situation leads the trips to indirect routes, longer distances, and increased travel time [7] . Therefore, the most indirect route trips are assumed to be made for far-away places to minimize the lost time. Some usual trip purposes of carpool are shopping, time-out activities, school, picking up children, and work. But the longest trips via carpool are generally found to be work-based [6] .",

Commonly, a mobile phone application is specified by ridesharing systems. The literature always addresses this type of carpooling as dynamic carpooling [11] .

Traffic congestion due to the inclination in the car ownership rate has become a serious problem in today's world [16] . Central business districts mostly meet the rise in vehicle ownerships because it attracts people due to the various facilities. Islamabad is also one of the same cases. Currently, traffic congestion is not a severely noticeable problem in Islamabad. However, the city will meet this issue in the future as the city's population is rapidly growing every year with a growth rate of 3.05% [17] (Fig. 1 ) and so the auto ownership rate. Therefore, policymakers and transport planners need to consider strategic planning and transport studies for Islamabad in advance. Carpooling can reduce the auto ownership rate that can be proved as the most economical and feasible solution.",

Carpooling helps in reducing the number of vehicles of single occupancy [7] . It also allows travelers to get flexibility and low-cost trips. This traveling system is quite friendly to the environment, reducing emissions that keep society safe and natural [21] . As per the report of the US Environmental Protection Agency in 2005, travelers, especially the employees, can cash these benefits of carpooling, i.e., time-saving, lower costs. In carpooling, time utilization becomes greater than usual, i.e., time value for sleeping or reading purposes while traveling (because the rider does not drive). However, in the case of employers, parking lot demands reduce. Carpooling can use existing infrastructure, so public investments are also not required to construct separate traffic lanes [22] .",

Their offered policies, rules, regulations, and facilities were also being analyzed to improve carpool involvement. This research categorized the key factors affecting carpooling into two main groups, i.e., \"internal\" and \"external\" factors. Internal factors include demographics and judgmental aspects while external factors include interventions and on spot situational aspects. As per the current situations, new technologies and modernizations are introduced into our society so the \"sharing economy\" idea is on the top priority [4] .

Ridesharing in Canada and the USA represents almost 8 to 11% of the transport mode share. Also, there is a need to evaluate its association with traffic congestion, structure development, emissions, and energy consumption [1] . In a similar context, Manzini and Pareschi [24] support carpooling as an effective approach for the reduction of travel demands and costs. The accompanying issues such as travel demand management action acceptability by the people and its usefulness in varying travel attitudes need to be assessed. Carpooling policies for such aspects may be influenced by various factors: lifestyle, sociodemographics, and travelers' intentions. Many researchers support the likely impact of individuals' lifestyle and behavior upon travel-associated strategies [25] [26] [27] . Some other studies have also been contributed to the significant influence of various attitudes towards individuals' travel behavior and travel demand management policies [28] [29] [30] . More specifically, a particular travel demand management policy is mainly succeeding due to the restrictions on personal vehicles and travel incentives [25] . Less cost, comfortable trip, and provision of well-kept facilities are found the main motives for a successful carpooling service as per the study of Sheldon and Heywood [31] . More travelers will carpool if the carpooling service was aided with high-occupancy vehicle lanes [32] . Seyedabrishami et al. [23] consider that high-occupancy vehicle lanes may not significantly affect travelers' carpooling tendency, though it reduces the travel time for ridesharing. Agreeing to Li et al. [32] , the main causes of carpooling are timesaving, liking excursions with others, and aiding the environment and culture. However, the program for matching the trip-mate, preferred parking at work, and owners' carpooling incentives are the least significant aspects of carpooling for trips [32] .",

Ostrovsky [41] also reported the socially optimal matching of the riders as the main outcome while studying the economical interactions among autonomous transport, carpooling, and road pricing. Srivastava [42] provided various factors like incentives, low cost, mixed approach, and incentives to drivers to improve such shared services use.

They found about 22% of car purchasers delayed buying a car while 12% of them even changed their decision of purchasing a car [46] .",

However, there are certain variables that negatively influence this service. Still it is essential to classify the possibility of such travel demand management strategies in the local socioeconomic perspective of Islamabad. This is very much important to study because the characteristics of the travelers change with respect to the city or a country. People of each city have their own unique lifestyles with socioeconomic characteristics regarding culture, population growth, transportation problems and its infrastructure, and land use pattern. In such situation, the imposition of procedures established on the judgments for other cities may poorly affect the whole transportation system of the policy-implementing city and which may cause the poor acceptability of the public towards it. Thus, it should be considered as a foremost priority for a vital study of the local factors of the targeted city Islamabad to introduce some new transportation policies.",

[49] reported motives for carpooling services such as cost reduction, free parking, and preference of traveling in high-occupancy vehicle lanes as positive factors for carpooling services. Similarly, constraints in preferring carpooling service such as privacy concerns, unknown passenger fellow, and sharing contact details were found in negative relation to carpooling service. de Almeida Correia et al. [28] found the problem of \"stranger partner\" variable in inverse relation to carpooling service and difficult to overcome. On the other hand, partners' acquaintanceship factor for carpooling service is reported as positively affecting users' intention to use carpooling service. Relying on the literature of these researches, all of these variables are considered for our study as well.

Content validity indicates the suitability and normal consistency among the objects and the tested variables. It actually answers whether the test is fully representative of what it targets to measure [62] . This study focuses on the structure validity, rather than the content validity, as the questionnaire items used in this research are established from the literature review. Structural validation alludes to the ability of objects of estimating the variables. It refers to the ability of the test to measure the concept that it wished for [62] . EFA was conducted to test the structural validity of the variables. The convergent and discriminant validity of the variables are presented in Table 4 . The values of composite reliability for the latent variables are all greater than 0.6 (see Table 4 ), which reports the good model reliability [63] . Similarly, the values of average variance extracted for all the constructs are > 0.5, confirming the convergent validity of the model [64] . Table 3 is obtained by using the master validity sheet in stat tools package prepared by Gaskin [65] in which the diagonal values are obtained from square rooting the value of AVE in Table 4 for each construct, which are all higher than the inter-construct correlations (off-diagonal values), thereby confirming discriminant validity for the model [64] . The covariance of motives with benefits is high (0.60), but still, less than the diagonal value of 0.71 thus fulfilled the validation.",

Promax oblique rotation was utilized for EFA with the options of \"sorted by size\" and \"suppress small coefficients\" under the value 0.5. PCA was performed in SPSS 23.0, and the outcomes are as shown in Table 5 , presenting the high factor loading on each item except I2 (0.524). Still, the overall loading on each construct is too good as the mean values are all greater than 0.70 [67] . Further, the communalities are all pretty higher than 0.3, so the results can be processed further with CFA. Cumulative variance explained 71.675% is quite good [67] . EFA is an iterative process that helps in assembling multiple observed variables into few latent constructs and drops off the irrelevant or insignificant variables from the study. Relying on the results of EFA, this study also dropped one latent construct of \"awareness about carpooling\" after the pilot survey, as it was not providing some reliable and significant results and the clear pattern matrix was unable to obtain in the EFA. Looking at the clean pattern matrix in Table 5 with no cross-loadings, we can conclude that the factors relating to the socioeconomic and environmental benefits of carpooling service have the greatest tendency for a traveler to use this mode as their factor loadings are comparatively quite higher and similarly the partner's acquaintanceship factor as well. Surprisingly, motives have the least loadings, which is a little contradictory to the reality, but can be improved in future researches by adding other suitable variables or subtracting any of the limited variables in our study. At the end, as expected, stranger partner variable is obtained with the lower factor loadings for the travelers to use carpooling service as their transport mode.",

This result is similar to that of Ashraf et al. [49] indicating that the best carpooling service would be the one providing the most possible socioeconomic and environmental benefits to the travelers. Stranger partner's factor-H2, where the partners in a pooled car do not know each other-negatively affected the intention to use carpooling service (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.16, \u0440 < 0.05). This is the same as we expected in our hypothesis and is obvious to human nature as well. de Almeida Correia et al. [28] also reported a similar result and found that this situation is not easy to overcome. Constraints for carpooling-H3-had a non-significant and positive effect on the intention to shift to carpooling service. Our analysis in the structural model did not support hypothesis 3 (\u03b2 = 0.21, \u0440 > 0.05). This means that the users' intention to use carpooling services is not affected by the constraints of preferring privately owned cars (see Table 1 for the description of variables). This additionally conveys the conclusion that the car users are also willing to shift to carpooling services if found to be more attractive in the context of cost or convenience. This outcome is quite interesting and different from our expectations but favorable to the introduction of carpooling services. Motives for carpooling-H4 (\u03b2 = 0.25, \u0440 < 0.05)-and partners' acquaintanceship-H5 (\u03b2 = 0.32, \u0440 < 0.05)-both positively and significantly affected the factor of intention to use carpooling services. The results are similar to Ashraf et al. [49] and de Almeida Correia et al. [28] . Ashraf et al. [49] studied the motives for carpooling for a very similar study area as ours. The behavior of the people is almost the same in both areas. The similarity of the results is showing high reliability of the variables and methodology used. de Almeida Correia et al. [28] conducted a study on carpooling using the SEM technique and found that the partner acquaintanceship is highly relatable to the choice of carpooling. Different types of iterations were made, and a positive impact of acquaintance and a negative impact of stranger variables were concluded respectively.",

On the other hand, unmarried males are more oriented towards carpooling with female partners. Similar partner matching has always been an issue in carpooling systems.

Various schemes can be incorporated in carpooling services (e.g., free parking lots and prioritizing high occupancy vehicle lanes) to build the practicality of carpooling services for decreasing car ownerships. Concurrently, the local government ought to create strategies to control the increasing car ownership rate (e.g., imposing parking fees on personal car use, car use restrictions, and low emission zones).
