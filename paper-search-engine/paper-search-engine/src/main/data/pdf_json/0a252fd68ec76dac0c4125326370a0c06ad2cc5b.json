In response to the pandemic, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the use of COVID-19 serological tests through Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) to make COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests widely available to help identify individuals with an adaptive immune response indicating recent or prior infection [5] . Serology tests, or immunoassays, play a significant role in the fight against COVID-19 [6, 7] . A prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a lower risk of infection, with an estimated protective effect of up to seven (7) months following primary infection; this supports the conclusion that convalescent plasma with specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 has powerful antiviral activity, which can reduce the viral load and mortality in patients with active COVID-19 infection [8] [9] [10] .",

            "text": "An analysis was run on 99 patients who completed the study (Table 4) . Thirty-seven (37) patients who had negative COVID-19 RT-PCR were tested and found antibody negative by using the CLUNGENE \u00ae test (95% CI, 90.60~100.00%). Three (3) out of four (4), or 75%, of RT-PCR positive COVID-19 subjects tested prior to day 7 of symptom onset were antibody positive (95% CI, 30.06~95.44%). Twenty-three (23), or 100%, of RT-PCR positive COVID-19 subjects tested positive between day 8 and 14 from symptom onset (95% CI, 85.69~100.00%). A total of 33 out of 35, or 94.28%, of RT-PCR positive COVID-19 subjects tested positive after day 14 from symptom onset were antibody positive (95% CI, 30.06~95.44%). In all 62 patients with confirmed COVID-19 with RT-PCR, the combined sensitivity of IgM and IgG was 96.77% (95% CI, 88.98-99.11%), meaning that there was 96.77 positive agreement between a positive RT-PCR test and a positive antibody test. The specificity was 100% (95% CI, 88.4-100.0%), meaning there was 100% agreement between a negative RT-PCR test and 100% negative antibody result. These results are displayed in Table 5 . The positive predictive value can be calculated, but the result is dependent on the prevalence of disease in the community. If a test for a disease has 96.77% sensitivity and 100% specificity, and the disease prevalence is 10%, the positive predictive value (PPV) is 100%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) is 99.64%. At the time of this publication, the positivity rate for the nares SARS CoV2 RT-PCR tests was between 8.2% and 10% in San Diego, CA (San Diego County), and Indianapolis, IN (Marion Country) [20] .",

However, we see the potential for a much broader use and recommend a combined approach that uses both RT-PCR and serological testing. The advantage of the CLUNGENE \u00ae antibody test is its simplicity, since there is no need for specialized laboratory personnel to perform and interpret results. The low rate of false positivity makes this test ideal to rule in disease and eliminate the need for further RT-PCR testing if seroconversion occurs, since the CLUNGENE \u00ae antibody test can diagnose most infected COVID-19 patients. If the test is negative, a recommendation should be made to have a follow-up RT-PCR test.",
