Universal masking and social distancing have been widely adopted by Hong Kong citizens since the first reported case of COVID-19 on January 23, 2020. According to four crosssectional telephone self-reported surveys among the general adult population in Hong Kong by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, the percentage of individuals wearing masks was 74.5% on January 20-23, 2020 (n = 1,008), 97.5% on February 11-14, 2020 (n = 1,000), 98.8% on March 10-19, 2020 (n = 11,449) , and 99% on April 9-24, 2020 (n = 10,421) (17) . Universal masking in public areas was voluntarily performed by Hong Kong citizens as a preventive measure against infection by . Social distancing measures were voluntarily practiced by public and implemented by the government beginning January 25, 2020 and include closing schools, encouraging work from home policies, closing recreational business and bars, and banning gatherings of more than four people in public places. These infection controls were shown to associated with a relatively low rate of COVID-19 in the first 4 months of 2020 and early termination of influenza season in Hong Kong, a city with close proximity with mainland China (18) . Our previous study suggested that universal masking and social distancing were associated with significant reduction in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a local hospital in Hong Kong (19) . In the current study, we further assessed hospitalization due to asthma exacerbations and the length of hospital stay on a territory-wide basis in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The average monthly admission counts and the standard deviations (SDs) for asthma and other diseases in January 2015 to December 2019 (baseline period) and January 2020 to April 2020 (COVID-19 period) were compared. The masking percentage in 2015-2019 was taken as 1%, accounting for the immunocompromised patients and pregnant women. We used g regression to compare the LOS of individuals between the two time periods, with age at admission controlled as a covariate. Twosided tests were conducted for general difference, and we set 5% as the significance level in the analysis. Fisher's exact test was used to compare mortality rates and mechanical ventilation. The numbers of admissions in the two time periods were classified into two categories (for mortality: death/alive or whether there is need for mechanical ventilation) and hence formed a two-by-two contingency table. The percentages of AQHI grades (high to serious) in the different periods were compared by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Further details of these biostatistical methods are listed in Appendix 1.

Comparing January to April in 2015-2019 to January to April of 2020, the admission count decreased by 24.2% (95% CI, 18.5-29.6%; P , 0.0001), from 271 admissions per month to 205 admissions per month (Table 1) , and was statistically significant in five of seven healthcare regions (Figure 1 ). Change in ambient temperature had minimal effects on ischemic stroke and gastric ulcer. An increase in temperature by 1 C (1.8 F) was associated with decrease in ischemic stroke admission by 0.8% (95% CI, 0.6-0.9%; P , 0.0001) and in gastric ulcer admission by 0.8% (95% CI, 0.5%-1.2%; P , 0.0001). An increase in the percentage of AQHI (high to serious) had a statistically insignificant effect on myocardial infarction (P = 0.052) but was associated with a decrease in ischemic stroke admission by 0.46% (95% CI, 0.17-0.75%; P = 0.0021) ( Table 1 and Figures 1 and 3) .",

A decrease in acute coronary syndromes admissions was also observed in another study (23) . However, our study showed a significant decrease in admissions for asthma exacerbation when compared with admissions for other common diagnoses, which could not be explained by healthseeking behavior alone. Compared with historical records, a drastic decrease in pediatric asthma-related emergency department visits was observed in two U.S. children's hospitals (24, 25) . Reasons for the observed decrease could include school closures preventing transmission of conventional respiratory viruses, reduced exposure to outdoor allergens, reductions in atmospheric pollution, and better parental supervision of asthma drugs (26) . Despite the introduction of newer therapies such as biologics and bronchial thermoplasty to prevent asthma exacerbation (27) (28) (29) (30) , the hospitalization numbers were not reduced from 2015 to 2019. Possible explanations include that biologics and bronchial thermoplasty both have stringent inclusion criteria, and the reduction in exacerbation is not absolute. Currently, omalizumab, mepolizumab, and benralizumab are available in the Hospital Authority's drug formulary and can only be prescribed in patients with asthma with elevated IgE or eosinophilic asthma. Patients who have exacerbations can have mild asthma as well. The significant decrease in hospitalization for asthma exacerbations in early 2020 could be due to nonpharmacological interventions. The practice of wearing surgical masks was proved to have protective effects against respiratory infections and transmission (31, 32) , and respiratory tract infection is a common trigger of asthma exacerbations (5) (6) (7) (8) . A high percentage of mask wearing was observed with a decrease in asthma exacerbation and influenza incidence in Hong Kong. We proposed that universal masking and social distancing have both contributed to a decrease in the transmission of respiratory tract infections and, hence, asthma exacerbations. This is supported by our results, which showed that an increase in masking of 1% leads to a 0.8% fall in admission, which is statistically significant. With the drastic increased in masking percentage in Hong Kong to 99% of the population, the admission numbers of ORIGINAL RESEARCH asthma exacerbation in the territory fell drastically by 53.2% together with a fall in influenza incidence (Figure 4) .",

The need for ventilatory support and mortality both trended toward a decrease in early 2020. Longer LOS was observed in patients with severe asthma (22) . However, our study showed that the LOS in 2020 was only shortened by 4.8 hours compared with all months in 2015-2019 and by 6 hours compared with January to April of 2015-2019 (Table 1 ). This phenomenon was observed in our study without taking account into the possible change in hospital efficiency during COVID-19 pandemics. Shortening LOS in terms of hours might not have any significance in clinical severity of the patient. However, this might reduce healthcare expenses, as the cost per patient day is $6,090 Hong Kong dollars ($785.4 U.S. dollars) in a general ward under the Hospital Authority. In our study, patients admitted for asthma exacerbations in 2020 had comparable severity with those admitted in 2015-2019. Respiratory viral and bacterial infections are important causes of asthma exacerbations and were observed in near-fatal asthma (8, 36, 37) . Universal masking can prevent the transmission of respiratory viruses and hence may have a role in reducing the frequency of severe asthma exacerbations. This is further supported by the similar findings from our group that universal masking can reduce COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization (19) .",

Hong Kong had effective infection control measures, leading to a relatively small number of COVID-19 cases in the first half of 2020. The health-seeking behavior of people in Hong Kong might be different from that in other countries, as suggested by the 25.7% reduction in myocardial infarctions in Hong Kong compared with 40% in England during the COVID-19 pandemic (23) . Our study provided important information on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on common respiratory diseases in a city with a relatively low burden of COVID-19 and suggested that social distancing and universal masking are important low-cost measures to prevent hospitalization for asthma exacerbations that can be practiced in the future.

Patients with mild asthma exacerbations who were seen in primary care or did not require admission and those who attended emergency departments but were not admitted were not included in this study. However, patients with severe asthma attacks were referred to the hospital by the primary care unit and admitted on the basis of clinical need after assessment by clinicians in the emergency department. Hence, our study focused on the group of patients with asthma attacks that required hospital admission. Our study also showed that the LOS of patients was 3.63 days in 2015-2019 and 3.38 days in 2020. The number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation and mortality related to asthma exacerbations was also lower in 2020 compared with that of the past 5 years, which suggested comparable severity in patients admitted for asthma attacks in the two periods. Moreover, this was an observational study that focused on the relationship between changes in environmental factors, including universal masking and social distancing, and hospitalizations for asthma exacerbations. Other factors, including ambient temperature and age of patients, were also taken into consideration. Our study was an ecological comparison that could not ascribe a causal relationship between wearing masks and social distancing with hospitalization for asthma. The phenomenon was observed with the possible relationship analyzed, which might or might not be accountable for the significant reduction in admission for asthma exacerbation.",
