Such a strategy requires recognition of the need for appropriate vaccine deployment, in accordance with local health system contexts and is not merely about obtaining funding to support poorer countries with vaccine access [7] . ASPHER further calls on national governments to contribute to a coordinated international effort to ensure vaccine deployment programmes are comprehensive and fit for purpose, with considerations made regarding the circumstances within countries in which they are administered. Additionally, we call on national governments to strengthen issues around anticipating new variants and decreasing effectiveness of vaccines, proactively planning for if/when vaccines stop working to prevent mild/moderate disease as well as considering how countries are reimbursed for vaccines purchased which may be less effective. Finally, it is essential that national governments evaluate their need to access global vaccine stockpiles, bearing in mind the context of global equity.",
