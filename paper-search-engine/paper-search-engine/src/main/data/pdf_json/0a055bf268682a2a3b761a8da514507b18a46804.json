We utilise coarse-grained normal mode analysis to model the dynamics of Spike and calculate transition probabilities between states for 17081 variants including experimentally observed variants. Our results correctly model an increase in open-state occupancy for the more infectious D614G via an increase in flexibility of the closed-state and decrease of flexibility of the open-state. We predict the same effect for several mutations on glycine residues (404, 416, 504, 252) as well as residues K417, D467 and N501, including the N501Y mutation recently observed within the B.1.1.7, 501.V2 and P1 strains. This is, to our knowledge, the first use of normal mode analysis to model conformational state transitions and the effect of mutations on such transitions. The specific mutations of Spike identified here may guide future studies to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and guide public health in their surveillance efforts.",

We show how a computational method called normal mode analysis that treats protein dynamics in a simplified manner is capable to predict the higher propensity of the Spike protein to be in the open state in which it is capable to interact with the human ACE2 receptor and thus facilitate cell entry. Because the simulation of the simplified computational model is relatively less demanding on resources than alternative methods, we were able to simulate over 17000 mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to identify multiple mutations that if they were to appear as the virus continues to evolve, could confer an evolutionary advantage. As a matter of fact, our predictions foresaw the emergence of particular mutations such as N501Y that appeared in several variants of concern. Our results can inform public health regarding new variants and serves as a proof of concept for the application of normal mode analysis to study the effect of ",

Among all outbreaks of aerosol transmissible diseases in the 21st century, the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus [1, 2] , has the highest infection and death cumulative numbers-61 million infections and over 1.4 million deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiological report of December 1, 2020 [3] . Recent WHO reports also show significant weekly increases in the number of infections and deaths as countries start to face upcoming waves of the disease. In 2003 the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pandemic caused 8,098 infections and 774 deaths before it was brought under control [4, 5] . In 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak caused 2499 infections and 858 deaths, presenting the highest fatality rate [6] . SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as coronaviruses in general, present considerable mutation rates, which may contribute to future outbreaks. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to have a mutation rate close to the ones presented by MERS-CoV [7] and by SARS-CoV [8] , as well as other RNA viruses, showing a median of 1.12 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mutations per site per year [9] . The high mutation rate may in part be responsible for the zoonotic nature of these viruses and points to a clear risk of stillundetected additional members of the coronavirideae family of viruses making the jump from their traditional hosts to humans in the future. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (Uniprot ID P0DTC2) is responsible for anchoring the virus to the host cell. The entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and other lineages of human coronaviruses is the human cell-surface protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Uniprot ID Q9BYF1) [10] . Therefore, studying the Spike protein family is essential to understand the evolution of coronaviruses.",

The S1 subunit comprises the N-terminal domain (NTD), located in the peripheric part of the extramembrane extreme, and the receptor-binding domain (RBD), the most flexible site, located in the central part of this same extreme. The S2 subunit consists of the fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptad repeat 2 (HR2), the transmembrane domain (TM), and the cytoplasmic tail (CT) (Fig 1) . The interaction between Spike and ACE2 relies on Spike being in its open conformation, in which the receptor-binding domain (RBD) is extended [11] . The study of the binding properties between Spike and ACE2, although important, cannot explain all the nuances of the infection mechanism. An example of this limitation is the comparison between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which have different rates of infection even though they share similar Spike-ACE2 affinities [12] . These facts lead us to consider the contribution of Spike protein dynamics to the infection process.",

These methods, however, are limited with respect to their ability to study the effects of mutations on dynamics since they are either extremely taxing on computational resources in the case of MD or agnostic to the nature of amino acids in the case of traditional coarse-grained NMA. In the past, our group developed a coarse-grained NMA model called ENCoM (for Elastic Network Contact Model) that considers the chemical nature of amino acids and their interactions and consequently their effect on dynamics [25] . This makes ENCoM perform better than other NMA models on traditional applications but more importantly makes it the only coarse-grained NMA model capable of predicting the effect of mutations on protein stability and function as a result of dynamical properties [26] [27] [28] . As a coarse-grained NMA model, ENCoM is not much costlier to run than other traditional NMA models and this makes it very attractive as a tool to screen the effect of mutations in a high-throughput manner.",

Experimental analysis of the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutation D614G and the comparison between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins show unique dynamic characteristics that correlate with epidemiological and experimental data on infection. The present work shows that we can replicate such results computationally, suggesting that rigidity or flexibility of different Spike conformational states affects infectivity. We present a high throughput analysis of simulated single amino acid mutations on dynamical properties to seek potential hotspots and individual Spike variants that may be more infectious and therefore may guide public health decisions if such variants were to appear in the population. We also introduce a Markov model of occupancy of molecular states with transition probabilities derived from our analysis of dynamics that recapitulates experimental data on conformational state occupancies. This is the first application of an NMA method that derives transition probabilities from normal modes and employs them in a dynamic system to predict the occupancy of different conformational states. We model the occupancy of several variants and highlight those that may be useful in studying future epidemiological trends that could be responsible for new outbreaks and lastly, we expand and apply the methodology to multiple mutations in cases of variants of concern that that were observed during the COVID-19 pandemic with their full complement of Spike mutations.",

Since all states must have outgoing transition probabilities that sum to 1, we normalize these values after the addition of k. For a twostate Markov chain representing the open and closed states of the Spike protein, we obtain the diagram shown in Fig 2. All transition probabilities are computed using ENCoM and Eq 6. The parameters k and \u03b3 need to be optimized for the system being studied as they are not directly coupled to physical quantities because of the pseudo-physical, coarse-grained nature of the ENCoM model. Once the parameters are set, there is a unique equilibrium solution that gives the occupancies of the two states.

Each analysed site is represented by 20 VDS values, one of them being zero (corresponding to the amino acid found in the wild type). The 'max' option will show the top VDS score for each position. Therefore, it shows which mutation for that specific position represents the candidate with the highest predicted infectivity as defined here in terms of a propensity to higher occupancy of the open state. The 'min' option will show the lowest score for each position and the mutation associated with the candidate predicted as least infectious. The 'median' option returns the median score, presenting a general trend for any given position, and 'var' shows the variance between the results for each position, highlighting sites in which mutations to different residues lead to a broader range of VDS values. Furthermore, for the mutations for which occupancy was calculated, the data can be accessed through the same menu. As new occupancy data is calculated, it will be added to this resource.

However, those that occur near the surface are more likely to represent single residue variations of the Spike protein that lead to a stable, correctly folded protein. Therefore, the stability of specific mutations highlighted in this work, unless otherwise stated (such as those already observed experimentally or within the RBD domain as stated below), needs to be validated experimentally.",

It is unclear if any additional conformational states other than those with either all three RBD domains in the closed state or only one RBD open state are biologically relevant. Specifically, Yurkovetskiy et al. [45] observed an occupancy for states with two or three RBD domains in the open conformation, but these were not observed by Gobeil et al. [30] and Xiong et al. [34] or taken into consideration in several other structural studies [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . As such, we employ the two-state model shown in Fig 2, with one state representing all three RBD domains closed and the second state representing one RBD open. The Markov model calculation of occupancies requires two parameters (see Materials and Methods) that were optimized based on experimental data for six Spike variants. These variants were: S-GSAS/D614, an engineered Spike with the sequence GSAS in the Furin cleavage site and no 614 mutation; S-GSAS/G614, with the same Furin site modifications and the D614G mutation [30] ; S-R, the Spike protein with original Furin site RRAR; S-R/x2, with added S383C, D985C mutations inducing a disulfide bond; S-R/PP, engineered with two prolines in positions 986 and 987; S-R/PP/x1, in which from the double prolines sequence the mutations G413C, V987C were performed to induce a disulfide bond [34] . It is worth stressing that all 6 variants used to calibrate the two parameters affecting the occupancy were modelled Table 1 on the same open and closed state conformations. All differences in observed occupancies and the agreement with experimental occupancy data came about as a direct consequence of the effect of the mutations on the normal modes and derived transition probabilities and not as a result of structural differences between variants. We obtained a good fitting to the experimental results with k and \u03b3 of 0.5 and 0.001, respectively (Pearson correlation = 0.89, p-value = 1.94x10 -2 ). Predicted occupancies of the open and closed states for each of the six variants above, as well as the experimental data, are presented in Table 2 . ",

The fact that variants in this position do not seem to be prevalent in outbreaks to date, points to the possibility that this position may be under additional functional constraints that prevent the emergence of variants. A number of other glycine residues could also accept mutations that we predict to increase the occupancy of the open state: G72W; G404W; G413M; G416E,W; and G404I. In fact, three of the top four mutations are mutations on glycines. A number of other potential mutations are adjacent to the glycine residues above. Namely, R403S and K417D,E,G,P. Additionally, D467P,W and I468T are also positions that are adjacent to others that can accommodate mutations that may lead to a conformational shift favouring the open state. The mutation that favours the open state the most in our calculations is N501W with \u0394S vib (open) = 6.02x10 -1 J.K -1 and \u0394S vib (closed) = 2.30x10 -1 J.K -1 and a resulting VDS value of 3.72x10 -1 J.K -1 leading to occupancies compared to those of the wild type (in parenthesis) of 62.7% (25.8%) and 37.3% (74.2%) for the open and closed states respectively. It is important to stress, as discussed in Materials and Methods, that the calculations are performed using structures containing a modified Furin recognition site and prolines in positions 986 and 987. Furthermore, the contribution of vibrational entropy changes is one among potentially several effects, the overall importance of which remains to be determined. Therefore, relative changes in occupancy are relevant whereas the specific values are less so.",

COG-UK recently detected a strain containing the mutation N501Y that has been observed to be spreading rapidly at the time of writing. We believe that shifts in occupancy may be in part responsible for its emergence. According to our calculations, the N501Y mutant shows \u0394S vib (open) = -1.60x10 -2 J.K -1 and \u0394S vib (closed) = 2.37x10 -1 J.K -1 , with VDS = 2.53x10 -1 J.K -1 . The predicted occupancies for the N501Y mutant compared to those of the wild type (in parenthesis) are 54.3% (25.8%) and 45.7% (74.2%) for the open and closed states, respectively. Therefore, the N501Y mutant shows a marked increase of the occupancy of the open state relative to other mutations. Additionally, this mutation was shown to also increase binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor relative to the wild type with a \u0394log 10 (K D,app ) of 0.24 [53] . Therefore, we predict that N501Y has a strong potential to contribute to increased transmission. The calculations above were performed in the context of D614. However, the double mutant representing the N501Y mutation in the context of G614 also shows an increase in the occupancy of the open state to 35.06%. The recently observed A222V mutation on the other hand [54] , does not show in our analysis any propensity of altering the occupancy of states with a negative VDS of -1.64x10 -2 J.K -1 . Predicted occupancies for A222 and V222 are nearly identical either in the context of D614 (WT) or the mutant containing G614.",

First and foremost, some of the in silico mutations discussed may not be thermodynamically stable, may affect expression, cleavage, or binding to ACE2, and our approach does not consider that Spike is, in fact, a glycoprotein and the sugar molecules may have an effect on dynamics. However, the agreement between our model and experimental observations as described above shows that the simplified model of Spike and the coarse-grained methods used here allow us to calculate dynamic properties of Spike that are relevant to understand infection and epidemiological behavior. It is important to keep in mind that all of the mutations that we discuss in Table 1 that lay within positions 331 and 531 within the RBD domain were already experimentally validated shown to be viable [53] . However, we highlight the need for experimental validation of our predictions particularly for those candidates that we believe would help elucidate the extent of the effect of the conformational dynamics of Spike on infectivity. Beyond in vitro biophysical studies, experimental alternatives exist such as using pseudo-type viruses or viruslike-particles that would not require studying gain-of-function mutations using intact viruses. Alternatively, loss-of-function mutations can be created with intact viruses and compared to the wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus to validate the role of dynamics on infectivity.",

The authors found that this mutation increased the occupancy of the up (open) state, in line with the results presented in our work. This makes us confident that our coarse-grained model lacking glycans still captures the essential dynamics of the Spike protein and validates its application for high throughput screening of mutations, which would be too costly computationally to conduct using long all-atom MD simulations.",

Both studies come to the same conclusion as ours, namely that the open state is favoured on the D614G mutant. More recently, the structures of the B.1.1.7 (UK), 501.V2 (SA) and P1 (Brazil) variants modelled here become available [68] . The authors show in all cases an increased propensity for the open state. In summary, while this computational work has been under review a number of studies corroborating our conclusions have appeared. Namely, complementary computational molecular dynamics simulations as well as experimental work for the single mutant D614G as well as experimental work on the UK, SA and Brazil variants.",

A positive VDS suggests that the mutation makes the open state less flexible and/or the closed state more flexible, favouring the open conformation relative to the WT. Conversely, a negative VDS suggests that the mutation favours the closed state more so than the WT. The computational cost of obtaining the VDS (modelling the mutation with FoldX on both states and computing \u0394S vib values for each with ENCoM) is approximately 20 CPU-minutes per mutant, making the total cost of these computations for the 17 081 mutants considered in this work around 0.65 CPU-year.

In Fig 9A we show the difference in occupancy between the open and closed states using a non-linear scale adapted to better show the results around the wild type occupancy. Whereas VDS values for particular mutations may hint at a more flexible closed state and more rigid open state, this is a global measure that may not reflect the necessary pattern of flexibility across the structure that leads to effective transition probabilities between the open and closed states. Yet, for the most part, VDS can predict the shifts in occupancy, showing a clear distinction between the 64 mutants predicted using VDS as shifting occupancy towards the open state and the 20 mutants predicted to shift the equilibrium towards the closed state (p-value = 2.04x10 -6 ).

Namely, B.1.1.7 contains N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H and deletions on positions 69, 70 and 144. As the number of normal modes is related to the number of amino acids, we are unable to model deletions while still making comparisons with the wild type strain given the nature of the quantities calculated (Eqs 2 and 6). Therefore, the deletions of three residues at positions 69,70 and 144 that are present in B.1.1.7 were not modelled here. 501.V2 includes the mutations L18F, D80A, D215G, R246I, K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G, A701V. P.1 variant includes the mutations L18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y, R190S, K417T, E484K, N501Y, D614G, H655Y, T1027I. The Dynamical Signatures for B.1.1.7, 501.V2 as well as P.1 show a strong rigidification of the open state and added flexibility of the closed state (S5-S7 Figs respectively), leading to VDS values of 5.30x10 -1 J.K -1 , 6.45x10 -1 J.K -1 and 6.88x10 -1 J.K -1 and open state occupancies of 36.2%, 35.8% and 39.8% for B.1.1.7, 501.V2 and P.1 respectively.The three variants show an increase in occupancy of approximately 40% relative to the wild type (25.8%). Despite our preference of modelling the smallest possible number of mutations and therefore using the engineered structure containing the modified Furin clivage site and proline modification, we also modelled B.1.1.7 (except the deletions), 501.V2 and P.1 using the original sequence of Spike with a non-modified Furin clivage site. We obtain 33.0%, 33.6%, and 38.9% occupancy for B.1.1.7, 501.V2 and P.1 respectively.",
