The sample consisted of 864 adults (66.6% females, M age = 47.61, SD = 9.23), of which 20.5% reported having a chronic illness. Associations between pandemic worry, vaccination intention, and HBM were ascertained using correlation and mediation analyses. Individuals with chronic illness reported a higher level of pandemic worry, higher levels of perceived threat, greater benefits from vaccination, had lower self-efficacy and bought more medicine and sanitary/hygienic products. No significant differences were observed regarding vaccination intention, barriers against vaccination, and changes in food buying behavior. We found that the relationship between pandemic worry and vaccination intention was partially mediated by the perceived threat of disease and the benefits of vaccination. Pandemic worry predicted vaccination intention directly but also through the contribution of the perceived threat of disease and the benefits of vaccination. These findings suggest that presenting evidence of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and the benefits of having the vaccine (especially for vulnerable groups, such as chronic illness patients) will encourage the population to follow vaccination recommendations.",

These models explained almost 60% of the variance in young women's vaccination intentions against Human Papillomavirus (HPV) (Bennett et al., 2012) . The HBM is one of the models used most extensively in health behavior research (Skinner et al., 2015) . The original model has four components: (1) perceived susceptibility of disease (i.e., the perceived probability of contracting the disease/infection); (2) perceived severity (i.e., how bad are the consequences of the disease); (3) perceived benefits of preventive actions or treatment; (4) perceived barriers in carrying out the recommendations regarding preventive actions (Janz and Becker, 1984) . Later on, other components were added (e.g., demographics, perceived control, self-efficacy) (DiClemente and Peterson, 1994) . It has been successfully used as a framework to predict vaccination intentions for seasonal influenza in children (He et al., 2015) and young adults (Fall et al., 2018) .",

That is the reason why, in the current study, we aimed to investigate two significant aspects related to these concepts: (1) the differences between adults with and without chronic illness in buying behavior, vaccination intention, pandemic worry, and the HBM components; (2) the HBM components as mediators of the relationship between pandemic worry and vaccination intention. Regarding the first objective, data showed that participants with chronic illness displayed higher levels of pandemic worry, higher levels of the perceived threat, and reported greater benefits from vaccination than healthy participants. This result is expected considering that participants are exposed to informational sources (e.g., television, newspapers, brochures) that highlight the liability of chronic illness patients when faced with COVID-19. Thus, this installs a sense of vulnerability in front of a potential infection. According to this data, even if the first group reported greater benefits from vaccination, this perception was not associated with a greater intention to vaccinate. This finding has negative implications for the success of a future vaccination campaign, as intention predicts behavior (Sheeran, 2002) . Additionally, vaccination uptake is suboptimal in many countries, including Romania (Habersaat et al., 2020) .",

Their normal functioning depends on the continuation of treatment for heart disease or diabetes. As such, they are expected to buy larger supplies of medicines during times of health crisis. This result is consistent with the previous one, reflecting the vulnerability of patients with chronic illness. There was no significant difference concerning food buying. Overall, participants bought 2.66 times more food during the state of emergency. A recent review highlighted that the psychological causes for panic buying are related to the people's perceived threat of the crisis and scarcity of supplies, people's fear of the unknown and uncertainty, coping styles, and the social influence of others (Yuen et al., 2020) . According to neuroscience, gathering enormous amounts of food is how evolution has taught us to manage periods of resource shortage. Therefore, it is deeply rooted in our brains to have extra supplies in times of crisis. Buying more sanitary hygienic products during pandemics (e.g., hand sanitizer, toilet paper) is an attempt to avoid diseases and is motivated by safety concerns and disgust regarding germs (Taylor, 2019) .",

In this research, there was no significant difference in vaccination intention between the two groups. In contrast, an online survey conducted by the global market research and public opinion specialist (IPSOS), Romanians diagnosed with a chronic illness had an overall greater openness to vaccination (8% declared that they are already immunized, and 57% declared that they are willing to get vaccinated) (IPSOS, 2021). One explanation stems from the fact that the two surveys were conducted in different moments of the pandemic. During the first state of emergency, the present research was done when no vaccine was available and little was known about the SARS-COV-2 virus, while the IPSOS survey was conducted in 2021 after the vaccine started to be available for older adults. Attitudes toward vaccination can change throughout a public health crisis (Fridman et al., 2021) . Most likely, subsequent scientific information about vaccination benefits and the pro-vaccination national campaign have encouraged vaccination behavior in people with chronic illness.",

The present data shows that the relationship is partially mediated by two components of the HBM model: the perceived threat of disease and the benefits of vaccination. Pandemic worry predicted vaccination intention directly but also through the contribution of the perceived threat of disease and the benefits of vaccination. The result is consistent with previous studies on influenza vaccination and the HBM theoretical framework on predicting COVID-19 health-related behaviors. For example, Liao et al. found in their study that vaccination intention mediated the effect of pandemic worry on vaccination decisions. Also, the perceived threat of disease, benefits, and vaccination barriers mediated the relationship between pandemic worry and vaccination intention during the H1N1 pandemic (Scherr et al., 2016) .",

It is reasonable to assume a temporal order between pandemic worry on the one hand and benefits and barriers to vaccination on the other hand. The assumption is limited without a longitudinal design for pandemic worry and the perceived threat of COVID-19, respectively COVID-19 self-efficacy. The sampling procedure does not allow for the generalization of results. Due to the online data collection, only Internet users could participate, excluding more vulnerable participants with lower academic or financial levels.
