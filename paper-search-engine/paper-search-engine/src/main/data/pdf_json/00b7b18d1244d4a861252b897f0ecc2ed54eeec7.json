However, tremendous efforts have been made worldwide to counter-steer and control the epidemic by now labelled as pandemic. In this contribution, we provide an overview on the potential for computer audition (CA), i.e., the usage of speech and sound analysis by artificial intelligence to help in this scenario. We first survey which types of related or contextually significant phenomena can be automatically assessed from speech or sound. These include the automatic recognition and monitoring of COVID-19 directly or its symptoms such as breathing, dry, and wet coughing or sneezing sounds, speech under cold, eating behaviour, sleepiness, or pain to name but a few. Then, we consider potential use-cases for exploitation. These include risk assessment and diagnosis based on symptom histograms and their development over time, as well as monitoring of spread, social distancing and its effects, treatment and recovery, and patient well-being. We quickly guide further through challenges that need to be faced for real-life usage and limitations also in comparison with non-audio solutions. We come to the conclusion that CA appears ready for implementation of (pre-)diagnosis and monitoring tools, and more generally provides rich and significant, yet so far untapped potential in the fight against COVID-19 spread.",

On March 11, 2020 , the WHO declared the disease triggered by the virus-COVID-19-as pandemic. The spread of the disease induced by the SARS-CoV-2 or \"Corona\" virus is assumed to underlie an exponential growth. However, whether there are long-term effects after recovery is yet to be fully researched. In the light of this dramatic spread, one is currently internationally witnessing drastic countermeasures that have not been seen in this form over decades in many countries. These include significant public \"shut-down\" measures to foster \"social distancing\" in order to slow down and control further spread.",

We then shift to the introduction of concrete use-cases how CA could benefit the ongoing global fight against the corona crisis.

            "text": "Speech analysis by computational means is highly related to the field of computational paralinguistics (5) . The field has several related recognition tasks on offer. These are often well-documented in the framework of competitive challenge events such as the Interspeech Computational Paralinguistics Challenge (ComParE). The latter has-perhaps closest related to the COVID-19 case-in its 2017 edition featured the automatic recognition of speech under cold (6), i.e., automatically recognising speakers affected by a cold from the acoustics of their voice. In the challenge of last year, the continuous assessment of breathing patterns from the speech signal appears relevant (7), e.g., as basis to recognise often witnessed symptoms of short-breathiness and breathing difficulties related to COVID-19. The last ComParE challenge further targets the recognition of speech under mask, i.e., the automatic recognition whether a speaker is wearing a facial protective mask, and the recognition of emotion of elderly, which may become interesting in monitoring the aftermath of social isolation of elderly, as was discussed, e.g., in the U.K. for 3 months. On the age scale's opposite end, toddlers' crying sounds seem to be the only indicator to understand if they are suffering from COVID-19 symptoms. In the ComParE challenge series, infant crying was investigated in 2018 (8) , and the valence, i.e., positivity of baby sounds in 2019 (9) . As symptoms of COVID-19 can also include lack of appetite, it seems further interesting to reference to the EAT challenge (10) : In this event, it was demonstrated that one can infer from audio whether speech under eating and eating sounds indicate eating difficulty and \"likability\" related to whether one enjoys eating. The assessment of sleepiness-a further symptom of COVID-19-was first featured in ComParE in 2011 (11) as binary task, and as continuous sleepiness assessment on the Karolinska sleepiness scale in 2019 (9) . Also pain such as headache or bodily pain can accompany COVID-19; speech under pain has also been shown to be automatically accessible (12, 13) . When it comes to individual risk assessment and monitoring, speaker traits may be of interest. High mortality risk groups include the elderly, and a (slightly) higher mortality rate was so far seen in male individuals (14) . Age and gender were also shown in the context of ComParE, and can be automatically determined reliably given sufficient speech material (15) . A history of health issue can further indicate high risk. A number of health-related speaker state information relevant in this context has been shown feasible such as individuals suffering from asthma (16) , head-and-neck cancer (17) , or smoking habits (18, 19) .",

As severe COVID-19 symptoms are mostly linked to developing a pneumonia, which is the cause of most deaths of COVID-19 as suggested by post-mortem biopsies (29, 30) , it further appears of interest that different breathing patterns, respiratory sounds, and lung sounds of patients with pneumonia can be observed through CA (31) , even with mass devices such as smart-phones (32) . Of potential relevance could also be the already possible monitoring of different types of snoring sounds (33) , including their excitation pattern in the vocal tract and their potential change over time to gain insight on symptoms also during sleep. Further, highest risk of mortality from COVID-19 has been seen for such suffering from cardiovascular disease followed by chronic respiratory disease. In ComParE 2018, heart beats were successfully targeted from audio for three types of heart status, namely, normal, mild, and moderate/severe abnormality. Hearing local proximity from ambient audio further appears possible (34) , and could be used to monitor individuals potentially too close to each other in the \"social distancing\" protective countermeasure scenarios. 3D audio localisation (35) and diarization further allows for locating previously recognised sounds and attributing them to sources. This could further help in the monitoring of public spaces or providing warnings to users as related to individuals potentially being locally too close with directional pointers. Audio source separation and denoising (36) of stethoscope sounds and audio (37) for clinicians and further processing can additionally serve as tool.",

Unfortunately, coughing and sneezing of COVID-19 patients does not differ significantly to human perception from \"normal\" patients. This includes lung and breathing sounds. However, (38) assume that abnormal respiratory patterns can be a clue for diagnosis. Overall, by that, it seems unclear if diagnosis from short audio samples of patients could be directly possible, given that most speech or body sounds are likely not to show significant differences for closely related phenomena such as influenza or cold, but a number of encouraging results show that breathing, coughing, and speech sounds could be suited (39) .

Monitoring of social distancing effects is largely related to affective, behavioural, and social computing in more general, for which there exist a range of other modalitiesmainly physiology, text, or video (51) . For monitoring of social distancing treatment and recovery, mainly the usage of medical testing and mere human assessment form major alternative options.",

We have summarised a number of potentially useful audio analysis tasks by means of AI that have already been demonstrated feasible. We further elaborated use-cases how these could benefit in this battle, and shown challenges arising from reallife usage. The envisioned use-cases included automated audiobased individual risk assessment, audio-only-based diagnosis directly from speech or (forced) cough-sounds and by symptom frequency and symptom development histograms over time in combination with machine learning, and several contributions to monitoring of COVID-19 and its effects including spread, social distancing, and treatment and recovery besides usecases for audio generation. At the time of writing, it seems that what matters most is a rapid exploitation of this largely untapped potential. Obviously, in this short overview, not all possibilities could be included, and many further potential usecases may exist. We also showed key limitations, but others will exist. Further, the authorship is formed by experts on CA, digital health, and clinicians having worked with COVID-19 infected patients over the last months-further insights from other disciplines will be highly valuable to add. The corona crisis demands for common efforts on all ends-we truly hope computer audition can add a significant share to an accelerated success of the crisis' defeat.",
