The different causes that are described and attended in acupuncture are energy stagnation, regulation of the energy dynamics of the Liver, eliminating humidity, transforming phlegm, toning and nourishing the Spleen and Heart, also nourishing and toning the blood and energy, being one of the main objectives to regulate the Shen9 11 15  . Some of the points that are useful in depression are the Yintang (extra) andBaihui (DM20), since some of their actions are to improve energy, clear the mind, calm the spirit and balance the function of the Liver 13 . On the other hand, studies have been carried out where in animal models the efficacy of the application of these acupuncture points for depression has been verified, for example, it is reported that in a murine model of induceddepression after applying electroacupuncture (EA) in the Yintang (extra) and Baihui (DM20) points during 14 sessions, signs and signs of a decrease in depression and an increase in the search to preserve life were determined, observing survival behaviors, compared to the group that received sham acupuncture (simulated), where the mice presented behaviors indicative of depression, decreased interest in continuing to live and presented a decrease in body weight 16 . As well as reports with patients with depression 10 17 18 , clearly the acupuncture groups improve on different criteria with respect to the control groups. Anxiety and depression have a high prevalence, especially in the female population and also pregnant women 19 , where also acupuncture showed clinically significant reductions in the severity of depression compared to conventional treatments 20 , with which changes observed in the symptoms and behavior of patients can be related to the effect of acupuncture. These results can be justified since it is described that serotonin (5-HT) released by the fibers of the nucleus of the raphe magnum, activates encephalinergic and GABAergic spinal neurons, while cholinergic and GABAergic spinal neurons are activated by norepinephrine (NE) released by noradrenergic fibers, these stimuli activated by acupuncture and EA may differ according to the frequency of the stimulation, at low frequency EA (<15Hz) increases the spinal release of methencephalins, endomorphins and beta-endorphins, while high EA frequency (15 to 100Hz) increases spinal dynorphin release 21 .",
