Recent Findings This international survey is being conducted through National Societies of Cardiology in selected countries from each of the six WHO regions and has the following overall aims: (i) describe prevalence of cardiometabolic and renal risk factors together with biomarkers in CHD patients; (ii) describe current risk factor management through lifestyle changes and cardioprotective drug therapies; (iii) provide an objective assessment of clinical implementation of preventive care by comparison with the lifestyle and risk factor targets defined in international and national guidelines; (iv) investigate the reasons for variation in preventive cardiology practice between regions and countries; and (v) promote the principles of best preventive cardiology practice. Summary This international survey will provide a unique picture of CHD patients; their cardiometabolic, renal and biomarker status; lifestyle and therapeutic management; and the quality of preventive care provided in all WHO regions.",

The 52-country INTERHEART study has shown that the classical risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) account for most of the risk of MI worldwide [1] . Therefore approaches to prevention can be based on similar principles worldwide, by targeting all these common risk factors, which have the potential to prevent most cases of premature myocardial infarction. The World Heart Federation Roadmap for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease identifies roadblocks and potential solutions to improve cardiovascular health and help reach the target in the Sustainable Development Goals: achieve a 30% reduction in non-communicable diseases, principally by reducing CVD, by 2030 [2] .",

The first survey was in 1995-1996, and this was followed by the second, third, fourth and fifth surveys in 1999-2000, 2006-2007, 2012-2014 and 2016-2018 , respectively, through the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Euro Heart Survey/EuroObservational Research Programme [10] [11] [12] . The objective of each survey was to determine whether in real-world practice patients with coronary heart disease were achieving the standards set in the ESC CVD prevention guidelines and whether there were any changes over time in lifestyle, risk factor and therapeutic management [13, 14] . The fourth European survey of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Diabetes (EUROASPIRE IV) merged with the EuroHeart Survey on Diabetes Mellitus and incorporated an assessment of dysglycaemia (impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and new diabetes) in all patients [15, 16] . The Vth EUROASPIRE survey continued this focus on cardiometabolic and renal disease in secondary prevention of 8261 coronary patients across 27 European countries [17\u2022, 18\u2022] . Outside Europe the largest international study of secondary prevention of CHD is the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiological study (PURE), undertaken across 17 countries, which reports in 7519 coronary and stroke patients the dominance of unhealthy lifestyles and the inequitable use of secondary prevention drugs in patients with cardiovascular disease in high-, middle-and low-income countries [19, 20] .",
