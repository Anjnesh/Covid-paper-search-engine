Concentrations of cytokines (IFN-g, IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, and TNF-a) chemokines (eotaxin, IP-10, MIP-1a, and RANTES) and growth factors (FGF, GM-CSF, IL7, and PDGF-BB) were higher in breastmilk of the study compared with the control group at 1st week postpartum. Immune compounds concentrations decreased on time, particularly in the control group milk samples. Time of nasopharyngeal swab to become negative influenced the immune compound concentration pattern.

However, information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on other immune compounds, such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, is lacking. These immune factors act in the prevention of infantile infection and can modulate the immunological development of the infant (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . In fact, their abundance in human milk is often inversely related to their scarcity in the infant's gut, characterized by a deficit of mucosal-related anti-inflammatory mechanisms, a limited production of secretory IgA, and a poor innate effector cell function (15) .",

Although this could simply be a physiological response from the mother to infection and not enough proof for it to be protective, our findings could also suggest that, in the presence of a viral infection, the immunological profile of human milk may be adapted to provide additional infant's protection against the maternal infection. Evidences for an immunological cross-talk between mothers and their breast-fed infants during infections, including severe viral respiratory infections, have already been provided (45, 46) . In our study, positive women were either asymptomatic or suffered mild disease, therefore the evolutive profile of immunological compounds in breastmilk was related to the time when RT-PCR swabs became negative, as a marker of disease state. Mothers who later became negative for nasopharyngeal RT-PCR presented persistently higher levels of r: Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate differences in concentration of growth factors between t milk samples of STUDY GROUP and CONTROL GROUP collected in week 5 postpartum. c r: Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to evaluate differences in the concentration of growth factors of the milk samples of STUDY GROUP between week 1 and week 5 postpartum. d r: Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to evaluate differences in the concentration of growth factors of the milk samples of CONTROL GROUP between week 1 and week 5postpartum.",

The distinct profile in immune compounds in breast milk of SARS-CoV-2 positive women could not be translated into effective gastrointestinal absorption and in a functional form to impact the infant immune system. Follow-up losses in the control group could eventually modify the results. Finally, the analysis of the immune compounds was limited to two milk samples, with an interval of approximately 1 month. We took this decision after confirmation of the lack of viral RNA in any of the milk samples over time. Therefore, we considered that the observation period was adequate to see eventual evolution of the immune compounds related to mother's infection status. On the other hand, a strength of this work is the huge variety of compounds that have been analyzed, and the systematic approach to both SARS-CoV-2 documented infection and control women.",
