Textmining, therefore, has been popular for developing new ideas. However, previous studies relied on using all keywords, neglecting a systematic extraction of servicespecific keywords. Therefore, this study suggests a new method for developing new service ideas-a data-driven morphological analysis for service ideation. The service-specific keyword extraction and filtering process are suggested to the datadriven morphological analysis. This study is expected to help managers to generate more service-specific and creative ideas for new services.",

Especially, the rise of COVID-19 pandemic has also led the rise of contactless services. For example, the interest in healthcare wearables and relevant services has increased tremendously, due to the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis (Phaneuf 2020; Lee and Lee 2020) . Many contactless services for social distancing have been developed and effectively utilized, including tracing apps, informative apps, and automatic robot-based services (Joo and Shin 2020; Chiang and Trimi 2020) . Therefore, companies seek innovation opportunities around marketplaces, since the dominant issue in NSD is to identify new and innovative service ideas (Alam 2007; Geum et al. 2016a ). Generally, the success of a new innovation is mainly dependent on its creativity (Chang 2011) .",

Naturally, this necessitates a systematic process and tool for new service ideation. Many scholars have argued that successful new services can grow from well-designed structures and orchestrated processes (Edvardsson et al. 1995) . In line with this discussion, many processes and techniques have been suggested in the literature, including theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) (Chai et al. 2005) , case-based reasoning (CBR) (Wu et al. 2006; Geum et al. 2016b ), morphological analysis (Lee et al. 2017) , or convergence-divergence model (Liu and Bligh 2003) .",

Morphological analysis has two strong advantages in idea generation. First, in terms of its inventive characteristic, it tries to find all possible values for each dimension. Second, in terms of its combinative characteristics, it combines all values of each dimension and tries to identify innovative and creative ideas (Geum and Park 2016) . Therefore, it has been extensively used in new service generation (Geum et al. 2016a, b; Lee et al. 2017 ).

Similar approaches have been used to employ patent information in NSD processes (Yoon and Park 2007; Feng and Fuhai 2012; Yoon et al. 2014) . Another approach to the automatic generation of morphological matrix mainly uses a dictionary-based approach. Geum and Park (2016) employed WordNet, which is a large lexical database of English. Because WordNet provides relationships among words including hypernym/hyponym and meronym/holonym, it can be effectively used for building dimensions and values in the morphological analysis. To address the limitation of the rigidity problem of WordNet, Wikipedia information has also been used to provide more practical and innovative ideas (Kwon et al. 2018) .",

Recently, scholars have studied the critical factors of NSDs or service typology analysis, which can provide good implications for NSD. Jaakkola et al. (2017) identified four different service types, namely, routine-intensive, technology-intensive, contact-intensive, and knowledge-intensive services, together with the prominent resources, practices, methods, and results. Kitsios and Kamariotou (2020) mentioned that the critical success factor for NSD can be manifold. In particular, a structured NSD plan can be an important success factor, together with market analysis and market knowledge. Biemans et al. (2016) collected and analyzed 230 articles on NSD for 30 years and identified research patterns on NSD. Thus, the authors identified that topics related to NSD have recently diversified across the boundaries. In particular, collecting customer information to design new services is considered an important issue, integrating big data and social media (Biemans et al. 2016) . focused on information-intensive service (IIS), and tried to identify key factors to characterize IIS: data source, data collection, data, data analysis, information on the data source, information delivery, customer (information user), value in information use, and provider network.

Figure 1 shows the overall process of this study. First, data are collected from a database that represents the service or market trends. To extract meaningful information to develop new service ideas, the following two processes are conducted: The first step is to clarify the main elements of new services. In this study, the main elements are defined as people, a system, and technology. The next step is to define rules for data preprocessing in order to extract relevant people, a system, and technology from the text. Next, keywords are extracted from the collected documents using POS tagging. To filter unrealistic and unnecessary keywords, a structural hole is employed. Then, a clustering analysis is conducted to downsize the number of keywords into representative types. After developing values from the text, a morphological matrix is developed, and new service opportunities are identified from the creative combination of the values.",

According to the servicedominant logic, the service-centered view is based on the idea that the service is the basis of all exchanges (Vargo and Lusch 2008; Vargo and Akaka 2009 ). This should be fully reflected in the data-driven morphological analysis in order to reflect service-specific characteristics. For NSD, Fitzsimmons and Fitzsimmons (2006) mentioned that the NSD process cycle is based on the development, analysis, design, and full launch process, with the service product consisting of the product, people, a system, and technology. Maglio et al. (2009) also suggested an Interact-Serve-Propose-Agree-Realize model, which is a normative model to cover the possible interactions between service Maglio and Spohrer (2013) mentioned that service system entities dynamically configure four types of resources, including people, technologies, organizations, and information (Maglio and Spohrer 2013, p. 667) . They argued that looking for adaptive advantages based on such resource types is required for innovation. Not directly related to the service context, some scholars have characterized the value, which is the main outcome in the NSD. Scholars such as Kim et al. (2013) and Geum et al. (2016a) suggested the concept of service dimensions and highlighted user, spatial, temporal, eventual, and value as key dimensions. Jeong et al. (2016) also summarized the hierarchy of values-economic, emotional, epistemic, social, and functional values (\u0160kudien\u0117 et al. 2012; Jeong et al. 2016) .",

Hierarchical clustering is conducted through a series of steps to build a tree-like structure using an agglomerative or divisive approach (Ketchen and Shook 1996) . On the other hand, nonhierarchical clustering does not build a treelike structure. It divides the dataset into a predefined number of clusters (Ketchen and Shook 1996) . When initial centroids are selected, each point is assigned to the cluster with the nearest centroid. Subsequently, the cluster centers are recomputed. This process is repeated until no change occurs for the cluster centroids (Ketchen and Shook 1996) .",

In general, when money is deposited from a bank to the cryptocurrency exchange, there is a fee and it takes time to confirm it. Considering the cryptocurrency market's volatility is very high, synchronizing accounts might be an idea for enhancing customer experience. Note that this action should be done through a careful review by financial authorities.",

However, independent two matrices can be integrated and combined for deriving more diversified and innovative services. For example, we can develop current morphological matrix using keywords that are frequently used in existing services, and also develop potential morphological matrix using keywords that are not yet frequently used but have potential for future innovation. It is also possible to develop morphological matrix for each industry, and combine two or more morphological matrices developed from different industries. This can contribute to supporting industry convergence and creating innovative and convergent services. ",

We suggest a service-specific preprocessing rule, suggesting people, a system, and technology as the core elements for new services. Several techniques have been used, such as text-mining techniques (POS tagging), Word2vec, structural hole, and clustering analysis. Rules for extracting relevant information were provided by considering the semantic structures of massive documents. The constraints of the structural holes in network analysis are applied to filter relatively unimportant words. Then, the pretrained Word2vec and k-means algorithms are used to cluster similar words. The completed morphological matrix provides significant implications for exploring inspiration for NSD. As a result, we suggest a concrete framework for applying data-driven morphological analysis. We contribute to the field in that it first suggests a systematic and generic process for building data-driven morphological analysis. The systemization of the people, system, and technology combinations can help managers understand how new services should be explored. These elements are used as dimensions of the morphology matrix, which is a critical part of new services. Most importantly, how to extract people, a system, and technology from massive databases with the help of natural language processing and data mining techniques is suggested. study filled the void of previous literature-subjective and expert-based development of morphology-by providing systematic, automatic, and simple procedures to create a morphological matrix. In particular, our approach Offering entry records(COVID-19 policy) of people to government using payment records of constructing a data-driven morphology matrix can be easily applied to any business area, which can possibly extend the application area of morphological analysis. Despite its contributions, this study is still subject to some limitations of this study. In every element, words that do not belong to the pretrained Word2vec model are excluded, and it can cause information loss. In addition, the k-means clustering method was used in this study, but k-means clustering has an innate shortcoming in terms of setting the k value. It is also believed that the use of other algorithms for more effective clustering could be an alternative. Another limitation lies in the naming process, which has been conducted based on expert judgment. Moreover, although the dimensions of the morphological matrix have clear characteristics, the use of other dimensions, such as more specific dimensions or extended dimensions, can be a fruitful avenue for future research. From the NSD point of view, the elements of the morphological matrix are quite broad, which can help experts to think of new ideas right away in a way of building a structure of the idea, but it is hard to create a specific detail of the service. To solve this issue, an advanced morphological matrix can be constructed using data that reflects detailed technology such as patents.",
