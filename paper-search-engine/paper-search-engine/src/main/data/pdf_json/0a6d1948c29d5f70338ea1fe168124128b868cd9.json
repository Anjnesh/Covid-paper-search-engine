After developing severe hypoxia on day 2 with oxygen saturation to the 60s off his nonrebreather mask, which he had removed, he was rapidly intubated. He had hypotension post-intubation which required vasopressor therapy; however, no overt shock was demonstrated. Lactate remained below 2.5, post intubation and serum creatinine remained below 0.8 mg/dL. Troponinemia worsened (0.194-0.682 ng/mL), and due to concern for acute PE, a heparin drip was initiated. The patient's hospital course would continue with fluctuating hypoxia on ventilation while receiving heparin (intravenous), sedatives, and occasionally paralytics. He was continuously febrile and required pressor support for suboptimal blood pressures. Duplex study revealed no deep vein thrombosis in lower extremities and transthoracic echocardiography was without intracavitary thrombus.",

A study of COVIDinfected patients in Wuhan, China, found 36.4% of their studied cohort to have neurological symptoms including dizziness, headache, ageusia, anosmia, and stroke. 2 While stroke occurred in 2.8% of the 214 patients reviewed in that study, the incidence of stroke occurred more frequently in patients defined as having severe infection (5.7% vs 0.8%), suggesting that risk of stroke is directly correlated with severity of disease. 2 Literature describing the characteristic stroke associated with COVID is limited. Despite several cases of young patients who developed large-vessel occlusion, early literature suggests that COVID stroke occurs more commonly in elderly patients with comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. 1,3 Similar to our patient, stroke in COVID has been associated with large-vessel occlusion occurring 1 to 3 weeks after symptom onset. Additionally, some reports suggest increased stroke incidence in males compared with females. 4, 5 This needs to be investigated further. As seen in our patient, COVID patients who developed stroke have had elevated D-dimer, ferritin, LDH, and troponins when compared with stroke patients without COVID. 4, 5 Several types of strokes including venous sinus thrombosis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral bleeds, and ischemic strokes have all been reported as a complication of COVID infection. 6 To date, ischemic stroke has been the most frequently reported. 6 Investigations surrounding the mechanism of cerebral ischemia in COVID patients are ongoing. Early literature has suggested several mechanisms.",

He became suddenly agitated on the third day of admission (day 8 of his illness), which was followed by respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation and sedation. He then, at one point, sustained massive bilateral ischemic stroke in both anterior and posterior circulations, as his underlying pneumonia progressed, with cerebral edema and downward herniation. This was likely due to intravascular thrombosis, as there was no deep venous clot in lower extremities by ultrasound and no cardiac thrombus by transthoracic echocardiogram.",

[7] [8] [9] Other authors have reported large-vessel stroke in young COVID patients with limited risk factors; however, the stroke usually occurred at the onset of COVID illness before patients presented to the hospital and involved one vascular territory. 8 Malignant edema has complicated stroke in other patients, at times requiring hemicraniectomy, 9 but this occurred again with unilateral infarcts. The closest case to ours was a 40-year-old woman who presented with severe COVID pneumonia and diabetic ketoacidosis, was intubated, and expired on day 7 of her illness; CT revealed massive right middle cerebral artery infarct with midline shift and downward herniation. 10 Our patient is unusual in that he developed massive bilateral ischemic infarcts in several vascular territories, with herniation, likely contributing to his demise. Indeed, autopsy reports in other patients have showed neuro-inflammatory changes in the brainstem as the most common finding, with no evidence of direct central nervous system damage. 11 Diagnosing acute stroke in COVID patients requiring ventilation is challenging, as use of sedatives can complicate evaluation of mental status and neurologic function. Additionally, the need for patient isolation makes thorough and frequent patient monitoring more difficult. Clinical trials investigating the efficacy of prophylactic anticoagulation are ongoing. To date, studies seem to suggest that patients are at risk for stroke even while on anticoagulation. For this reason, a structured and efficient method to neurologically evaluate patients with severe COVID is needed. For now, clinicians should have increased suspicion for stroke in patients with severe disease who exhibit change in motor function, mental status, and or rapid clinical deterioration.",
