Global research initiatives to determine optimal clinical management strategies are ongoing, but much remains unknown. To improve public health, the White House executed Operation Warp Speed in March 2020, which promoted the development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines by selected pharmaceuticals in order to accelerate the development of novel therapeutic agents to aid the response to this pandemic throughout the country [2] . Despite the efforts to release a COVID-19 vaccine in a timely manner, a Reuters poll conducted in May 2020 demonstrated that one-fourth of Americans were uninterested in getting the coronavirus vaccine once available. The common reasons included nervousness about the vaccine's quick approval and weariness about the risk associated with a new vaccine [3] . It is important to note that the general public's knowledge regarding COVID-19 may have been influenced by myths circulating on social media [4] . However, another survey revealed that participants were more willing to get vaccinated if they thought their healthcare provider would recommend vaccination [5] . Pharmacists are on the frontline of mass immunization efforts and play a vital role in recommending vaccines to improve public health. This involvement also makes pharmacists at increased risk for exposure, thus, emphasizing the importance to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The Department of Health and Human Services authorized pharmacists to order and administer COVID-19 vaccines under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act [6] . Previous research has shown that healthcare providers with high confidence in the benefits and safety of vaccines were more likely to accept vaccines for themselves and recommend vaccines to their patients [7] .",

These vaccine candidates include the Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. mRNA vaccine platforms and the Janssen viral vector vaccine platform [8] . The preliminary updates on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in phase III clinical trials may have influenced many pharmacists' perceptions within a short period of time. In a survey conducted among 400 pharmacists in November 2020, 52% of pharmacists were ready to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible, 74% were willing to administer the vaccine as soon as possible, and 37% were willing to receive and vaccinate patients as soon as possible [9] . In December 2020, the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) approved the United States' first COVID-19 vaccines Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) submitted by Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. [10, 11] . On 27 February 2021 the FDA's VRBPAC approved the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine under emergency use authorization [12] .

A previous study conducted by Petek et al. showed that familiarity with influenza disease did not impact the decision to vaccinate for influenza [14] . Pharmacists' perceptions of COVID-19 were assessed to gauge if the rapidly changing knowledge of the disease state would influence pharmacists' view of credibility for a new vaccine. Our study found that 67.1% of the pharmacists were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and 63.4% of the pharmacists were willing to recommend a COVID-19 vaccine at \u2264 1 year from the time of vaccine approval. At > 1 year after vaccine approval, 78% of the pharmacists were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and 81.2% of the pharmacists were willing to recommend a COVID-19 vaccine. There was a significant difference in pharmacists' vaccine decisions between the varying time frame of vaccine approval. Pharmacists with post-doctoral training were more likely to receive and recommend a COVID-19 vaccine than those without post-doctoral training. Pharmacists in indirect patient care settings were more likely to receive or recommend a COVID-19 vaccine than those in direct patient care settings. Lastly, pharmacists with increased personal experience and exposure to COVID-19 were more likely than unlikely to receive and recommend a COVID-19 vaccine. Pharmacist with no post-doctoral training were less likely to receive or recommend a COVID-19 vaccine than those with post-doctoral training. Pharmacist in direct patient care settings were less likely to receive or recommend a COVID-19 vaccine than those indirect patient care settings. Pharmacist without personal experience nor exposure to COVID-19 were more unlikely than likely to receive or recommend a COVID-19 vaccine.

The survey conducted by APhA showed that 69% of pharmacists would receive a COVID-19 vaccine at \u2264 1 year and 60% of pharmacists would recommend the vaccine at \u2264 1 year [9] . The APhA survey was conducted shortly after preliminary results for COVID-19 vaccines efficacy trials were published [15, 16] . Our survey was conducted from 19 September 2020 to 18 November 2020 (prior to release of any COVID-19 vaccine trial data) and showed that baseline willingness status of pharmacists to receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines were similar to their willingness status once the preliminary clinical trial findings were released. A major difference between our study and the survey conducted by APhA is that the APhA survey assessed pharmacists' willingness at three different time intervals: vaccination as soon as possible, after six months of experience with the vaccine, and after one year of experience with the vaccine. Although we assessed willingness at \u2264 1 year and > 1 year of vaccine approval, this difference between studies may be negligible in a real-world setting. COVID-19 vaccine distribution is decided by phases recommend by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention; therefore, recipients may not have the ability to choose when they will receive the vaccine within the first year of vaccine roll-out. The APhA survey also assessed how prepared pharmacist felt to administer COVID-19 vaccines as soon as they are available. Pharmacists had the option of stating the following: they are ready to receive and vaccinate as soon as the vaccine is available, they are in the final preparation stages and are ready to vaccinate patients as soon as the vaccine is available, they are not prepared to vaccinate in the first wave of the vaccination effort but plan to participate in future phases, or logistics of preparation are too difficult for them to participate [9] . This is a component that our survey did not assess but would be useful to determine what resources pharmacists need to feel prepared, in order to increase their willingness to receive and recommend vaccines.",

Reiter et al. conducted a cross-sectional survey which consisted of 2006 adults ages 18 and older during May 2020. Reiter et al. demonstrated that participants were more likely to get vaccinated if they thought their healthcare provider would recommend vaccination. The general U.S. population was also more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they reported higher levels of perceived risk of being infected by COVID-19, or perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine. The results from the general adult U.S. population also revealed that participants were less likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they were non-Latinx Black or had higher levels of perceived potential vaccine harm [5] . The rate of willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine was comparable to other studies done surveying the general adult population [5] . Since the general adult population consider healthcare providers as a major influencer in their vaccine decision, the need to increase pharmacists' confidence and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines is evident. We also did not analyze how willingness toward vaccination differed between race, although this may be important for future findings to address perceptions as they relate to health disparities.",

U.S adults showed that overall vaccine hesitancy has declined significantly by 10.8% from October 2020 (46%) to March 2021 (35.2%). U.S. adults were asked to rate their trust for the \"governmental approval process to ensure the COVID-19 vaccine is safe for the public,\" and the \"process in general (not just for COVID-19) to develop safe vaccines for the public,\" on a scale of one (fully trust) to four (do not trust).

Merks et al. assessed the readiness and willingness of pharmacists, trained and not trained through a pilot immunization workshop, to provide vaccination services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. Polish community pharmacists who underwent additional immunization training showed a greater readiness to provide immunization services as compared with those who did not receive training. The most common barriers affecting Polish pharmacists' readiness were: providing vaccinations will require more work, not enough training courses, and pharmacy facilities are not adjusted to provide these services [18] . Acknowledging that readiness and willingness for vaccination are not mutually exclusive, our findings were comparable in showing that those who have completed additional training were more likely than unlikely to receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines. This may emphasize the effects of educational training on vaccine acceptance. Our study did not analyze what resources are needed to overcome vaccine hesitancy in pharmacists or barriers in vaccine implementation in pharmacy practice settings.",

According to the Bureau Labor of Statistics, 42% of the pharmacy graduates work in a community practice setting and 26% of the pharmacy graduates work in a hospital practice setting, therefore, our study population is not representative of the pharmacist workforce data in the United States [19] . Moreover, there was no standardized denominator to accurately determine the survey response rates given the broad distribution across online platforms and email distribution lists from professional organizations. Lastly, our survey took place before multiple companies filed for the FDA Emergency Use Authorization which publicized th\u1ebd 95% effectiveness clinical trial data [14, 15] . This vaccine data could certainly affect the perceptions of pharmacists toward COVID-19 vaccines and the current survey findings may change based on the now available data.",

Pharmacists, as members of the front-line immunization effort, play a vital role in recommending and providing vaccines to improve public health. We aimed to assess pharmacists' willingness to receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines and factors that may influence this decision. Our study showed that although most pharmacists would receive and recommend a COVID-19 vaccine, a substantial proportion of pharmacists reports vaccine hesitancy to receive or recommend COVID-19 vaccines. Pharmacists prioritize similar clinical information when considering the decision to receive and recommend a COVID-19 vaccine.",
