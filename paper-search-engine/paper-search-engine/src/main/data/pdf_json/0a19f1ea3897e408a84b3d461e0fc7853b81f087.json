The authors included 19 studies: 6 RCTs, 3 non-controlled trials and 8 non-controlled studies with a total of 1141 participants. Interventions targeted both individuals and organisations, an included health system policy change. Mindfulness-based interventions were the most common with medium to large within and between group effect sizes for mindfulness outcomes, and small to medium effect sizes for other positive outcomes. The authors conclude that there is remarkably little evidence on how to improve PCP wellbeing beyond using mindfulness interventions, particularly interventions addressing organizational or system factors. A strong point of the review is that its protocol was pre-registered in PROSPERO.",

As they mention themselves, good mental health is not a synonym of flourishing, nor is mental ill-health a synonym of languishing. However, the two do have a relationship with each other and as the research on burnout, distress and mental ill-health is more extensive and exists for longer, it seems a pity to have excluded these studies in this review about GPs. Could the authors pay a bit more attention on the relationship between psychological symptoms and well-being in both the introduction and the discussion of their paper, reflecting on the impact of having excluded studies focusing on mental ill-health from their review? Methods I compliment the authors of having consulted a specialist librarian to support their literature search. The protocol in PROSPERO mentions that one reviewer (DNA) would initially review all titles and abstracts while a second reviewer would be consulted. In the manuscript it says that sample screening of titles was performed by two reviewers and showed excellent agreement. Could the authors comment on the number of titles were reviewed by two reviewers and the exact figure of the inter-rater reliability?",

Sixteen studies employed the Maslach Burnout Inventory or other stress-related measures. I do think it would be interesting if the authors could include the findings on the negative outcome measures, and the possible inter-relationship with flourishing, in their review. Discussion I really appreciate the authors' suggestions for future research. They are well structured, helpful and relevant, particularly the measures that can be taken to reduce bias. I agree with the authors that there needs to be more consensus and clarity of definition regarding \"physician wellness\". On the basis of their review, could they provide a few specific suggestions? The authors mention they endorse an intensified effort to explore organisational interventions to improve wellbeing and satisfaction. It might be interesting for them to refer to the possible impact of mindfulness and meditation on the quality of leadership necessary to achieve this. I have taken the liberty to refer to a few possible sources I know of: How medical specialists experience the effects of a mindful leadership course on their leadership capabilities: a qualitative interview study in the Netherlands. -020-1948-5 . Final report of Understanding and responding to societal demands on corporal responsibility (RESPONSE). Sixth framework programme, priority 7, \"Citizens and Governance in a Knowledge Based Society\". The results of the first field experiments on Corporate Social Responsibility training effectiveness ever attempted, reported in Ch. 9, show that: the standard executive education approach based on engaged discussions and case analyses fails to facilitate managers to shift towards higher probabilities to make socially responsible decisions. On the other hand, coaching programs based on introspection and meditation techniques, without any discussion about Corporate Social Responsibility topics, exhibit a significant impact on both the probability to act in a socially responsible way and on the factors that influence the probability to behave that way At last",

In defining wellbeing we draw on the well-established existing frameworks and definitions in the psychological literature, such as differentiating psychological wellbeing (Ryff, (10)), from subjective wellbeing (Diener, (11)) or flourishing (Seligman's PERMA, (12)). In terms of tools, for subjective wellbeing measures such as the validated Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS, (13, 14)) or 16) , and for Job satisfaction the Warr Cook Wall scale (WCW-JS, (17, 18)) could be useful.",
