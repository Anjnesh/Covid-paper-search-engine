However, evidence variability and the small number of studies make it difficult to draw a conclusion on the extent of the impact and the pathways to achieving positive change. More research is needed into the impact of SP programmes on participants, populations, and communities in terms of loneliness, isolation, and connectedness, especially in light of the surge in SP activity as a key part of pandemic response.",

            "text": "The example of the UK can help illustrate the believed linkages between loneliness and SP. In 2018, the UK Government published the Loneliness Strategy. Since then it has devoted significant resources to combatting loneliness and improving individual and community wellbeing, including engaging with numerous charities, to demonstrate its commitment to tackling loneliness and promoting social connections. 10 In 2019, the UK Government launched Universal Personalised Care (UPC), a system designed around six key pillars meant to give individuals choice and control over their mental and physical health. UPC was intended to help the UK health system enhance value for money and improve overall health and wellbeing, including through the reduction of loneliness. 11 The fourth UPC pillar is centred on SP. SP programmes employ link workers (also called community connectors, community navigators, and/or village agents) to guide participants to co-develop personalised solutions for their own health. As an asset-based, collaborative approach, SP programmes are designed to identify needs and resources, promote and develop individual and community capacities, and ameliorate symptoms and consequences of poor health. 12 With the UPC launch, the UK Government committed to reaching more than 900,000 people through SP by 2023-2024. Through this commitment, it was intended to also reduce loneliness and improve public health. 13 In the UK, there are four sectors associated with SP interventions. First, some general practitioner (GP) practices within the health sector are actively engaging link workers to accept referrals and work individually with people and families. Second, organisations in the voluntary and community service (VCS) sector individually with people and families supply an array of innovative and engaging activities for them to access for support and connection. This sector employs link workers directly and supplies many of the services that other link workers recommend.",

Impact areas in addition to loneliness include healthcare service usage 15,23-29 and social care service usage. 34 Two studies report individuals expressing in interviews that they feel less lonely/more connected to others 28, 29 and two report changes in loneliness scores across the participant sample. 22, 23 The highest impact reported is 69% of individuals feeling less lonely (UCLA 3-question version). 22 Two of the studies examine the extent to which age might impact social prescribing programme implementation and loneliness. 15, 22 One of these studies reports greater improvements in loneliness for individuals below 60 years of age in comparison with those aged 60 and above. 22 One examines age as a contextual factor determining the pathway between a social prescribing programme and healthcare usage outcomes. 15 Impact on the health and care system(s) and community Evaluation of the impact on health and care services is primarily focused on documenting numbers of GP visits, Accident and Emergency (A&E) visits, inpatient admissions, and outpatient Scale (ULS-8). person: Loneliness and social isolation are key threats to public health and can be addressed through SP. Interviews revealed that being a part of a group (family, community, and volunteering group) and feeling that one belongs to a community helps people feel less lonely. Participants report that having a positive relationship with link workers has helped them build selfconfidence, which in turn has helped them address their experiences of loneliness. Group membership alone is not directly and significantly related to primary case usage. Sense of community belonging should be considered when examining this pathway. system: GP visits: GPs, health coaches, and link workers recognise the limitations of the 'traditional medical model' and express concerns over addressing loneliness with medical provisions. GPs view SP as best model to address loneliness and reduce its negative health impacts. community: Primarily focuses on understanding how community resources can be used to reduce loneliness and healthcare usage, and less so on impact of the programme on community. Public Health Outcome Framework (ASCOF/PHOF) is used to assess the levels of social isolation and loneliness (used interchangeably). person: Participants felt less isolated or alone post-participation, 'feeling like they had someone they could turn to'. No direct evidence or discussion on the loneliness measure that was administered. 19% increase in people having 'enough social contact'. system: GP visits: 68% report reduction in GP appointments; 15% report increase; 17% no change. A&E: 7% report reduction in attendance; 1% report increase; 92% no change. Inpatient admissions: 9% report reduction in stays; 3% increase; 90% no change.

It shows that being a member of a group (family, community, and volunteering group) positively predicts one's sense of community belonging, which in turn predicts reduced loneliness and reduced healthcare usage. 15 This study also reports that GPs view social prescribing as the best model to address loneliness and its negative impact on health. 15 The nine studies diverge in how they assess impact on the community. One study reports greater participant awareness of available services and support. 25 Two report organisations expanding their service capacity. 27, 28 One reports a greater sense of community connectedness. 15 Five studies do not address programme impact on the community.",

Overall, social prescribing models designed to address loneliness have been largely viewed as helpful by both participants and service providers. Participants report feeling less lonely and more connected to others. Participants feel good about their relationship with a link worker and appreciate the service delivery model. GPs, volunteers, and delivery service members view social prescribing as a valid model to deliver comprehensive, people-centred, and integrated care, and some GPs view social prescribing as the best possible approach to successfully address loneliness. The positive impact appears as a large percentage of reductions in GP, A&E, and inpatient and outpatient services following programme implementation. However, the variability and paucity of evidence and lack of control group comparisons make it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the impact of the social prescribing model on loneliness in particular, or on public health in general.",

The relationship participants and social prescribers develop over time is a potentially useful way for individuals to become less lonely, reconnect with their community, and improve their physical and mental wellbeing.

Being able to distinguish between these related phenomena is an essential first step for mapping out needs and services required to help lonely individuals, who are likely to feel alone even in a crowd. Improved impact evidence is needed to know best how to reach lonely individuals and address complex health and social needs that emerge as a result of loneliness. In particular, we note the need to study links between an individual's level of loneliness and one's health and social care usage, as well as the impact of these individual attributes on one's wider community.",

In particular, much social prescribing in the UK is now being delivered through digital tablet, telephone, and email, with link workers connecting participants to social outlets virtually, helping to coordinate prescription delivery, and providing ways for people to connect to their communities while observing pandemicrelated restrictions. 36 Importantly, social prescribing has also reportedly eased much of the burden GPs expected to encounter during pandemic management, as GPs have been able to refer patients to social prescribing services based on telephone consultations, without causing anyone to physically attend a GP appointment. 37 It thus appears that social prescribing is filling the role it was originally intended to have. Systematic and rigorous evaluations to this effect are long overdue.",

Our work also demonstrates that the UK initiative to deliver person-centred care through social prescribing can only be based on evidence from the past 5 years.",
