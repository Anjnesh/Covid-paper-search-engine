Demand for hospital care is high as many patients with COVID-19 develop a severe form that can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure, which carries a 20% mortality rate (Gibson et al., 2020; Abate et al., 2020) . As of mid-July 2020, worldwide statistics indicated 13,150,645 total cases and 574,464 deaths, while the KSA had 237,803 total confirmed cases and 2,283 deaths related to COVID-19 (Medicine, 2020) . However, as the projected need for hospital care for patients with COVID-19 within the KSA is largely unknown, the length of stay (LOS) for inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 is one of the most critical factors in preparing for the demand for hospital care as the pandemic continues (Medicine, 2020; Rosenbaum, 2020; Rodriguez-Morales, 2020) . This study occurred during the initial wave of the pandemic in the KSA when the world was not yet prepared to cope with it's demands. It will be very useful to plan for successive waves in the allocation of resources to different regions since the regions experienced the peak at different times.",

The pandemic created demands and inflicted enormous financial costs on all aspects of healthcare systems worldwide to the point of such costly overburdening that many systems were forced into collapse even in advanced countries such as Italy (Rosenbaum, 2020) . LOS in hospitals represented such a large portion of costs, for example with average costs per diem in the USA of 73.300 USD and in China of 17,000 yuan, that this is especially worrying for developing countries with fewer resources to meet such a sudden crisis demand (Guo et al., 2021) . Understanding LOS and its consequences on the healthcare system from region to region in the KSA will help delineate the best standards for the medical profession to focus on care of those most likely to require longer LOS to improve health outcomes and shorten LOS reducing the financial burden. The example of Italy and other countries (Rosenbaum, 2020; Rodriguez-Morales, 2020; Rees et al., 2020) served as a wake-up call to the KSA to take early swift action prior to the first case identified in the KSA to prevent the spread of COVID-19, thereby avoiding the collapse of the Saudi hospital system (Komies, et al., 2020) . As it has been established that there is significant variation in the quality of care provided to COVID-19 inpatients among regions in the KSA (Alharbi et al., 2021) , we focused on LOS as one of the indicators that may measure utilization and provision of services among the 5 regions as proposed by the new Model of Care (MOC) under vision 2030. LOS is also critical for planning purposes for both the COVID-19 and future pandemics considering all factors that influence it, including comorbidities, complications, gender, age, region of residence, and other demographics (Rosenbaum, 2020; Rodriguez-Morales, 2020; Rees et al., 2020; Massonnaud et al., 2020; Castro, 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Wu and McGoogan, 2020) .",

A 2018 large cohort study on LOS in the Emergency Departments among the elderly in the Netherlands found that these patients experienced longer LOS in the emergency department and had a lower quality of care with an increasing demand on limited resources (Sir, 2019) . A review of studies on patients with COVID-19 concluded that LOS in general hospitals varied considerably from less than a week to 2 months (Rosenbaum, 2020 ). An early study conducted in the UK noted a range of 12-19 days in general hospitals among patients with COVID-19 who were not in an ICU (Vekaria, et al., 2020) . The health care system in the KSA is in the process of being transformed into a 21st century world-class health service governed by the Saudi Vision 2030 (Al-Hanawi et al., 2018; Hazazi and Chandramohan, 2017) . Vision 2030 calls for health care reforms to ensure that all citizens have access to high-quality healthcare, that primary care becomes the main engine of the system, and that competition and accountability will render a more efficient system. The reforms contained in this plan include reorganizing the existing 13 administrative regions into five busness units ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) . These are the Central, Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western, each with its own private holding company charged with administering the healthcare for that region (Health, M. o., VRO Health Sector Transformation Strategy., 2019) .",

The Central Institutional Review Board of the MOH approved this study's ethics, with the reference number 20-163E. Table 1 illustrates the demographic characteristics of our sample participants by BU. The highest proportion of patients with COVID-19 were from the WBU and EBU, with the lowest portion from the NBU. Participants were almost equally likely to be Saudi or Non-Saudi with a mean age of 50. Approximately threequarters of our participants were male.. Table 2 illustrates the clinical characteristics of the patients with COVID-19 according to the proposed five BUs. Inpatient mortality rates in the WBU (51%) and NBU (53%) were approximately double those in the CBU (25%). In contrast, mortality rates in the EBU were less than one-third the rate of the WBU (8%) and the SBU were less than half the rate (14%). Similarly, compared to the CBU, the ICU admission rates for the Western and Northern BUs were significantly higher, at 71% and 88% respectively, and were markedly lower in the Eastern and Southern BUs Regarding rates of inpatients transferred to another hospital, compared to the CBU, the Western, Northern, and Southern BUs had relatively lower rates while the EBU had a statistically significant higher rate (p < 0.0001). On admission, diabetes (42%) and hypertension (32%) were the two most frequent comorbidities, while immunocompromised and cancer each represented<5%. Participants with preexisting ARDS accounted for 12% while participants with obesity and cardiac disease were relatively equally distributed at 14% and 13%, respectively. The most frequent complications from COVID-19 were bacterial pneumonia (39%), sepsis (21%), and ARDS (8%). Multi-organ failure and acute kidney injury were significant complications, while arrhythmia, hepatotoxicity, and GIT perforation were less common complications (p value < 0.0001). Pre-existing chronic disease and the occurrence of complications from COVID-19 showed statistically significant regional differences (p value < 0.0001 for all). Significantly higher combined rates of chronic diseases were reported in the Northern and Western BUs compared with the CBU, accompanied by higher mean ages. Conversely, there were significantly lower combined rates of chronic diseases in the Southern and Eastern BUs. Regarding complications from COVID-19, the WBU had a significantly higher sepsis occurrence than other BUs, ARDS, acute kidney injury, hepatotoxicity, GIT perforation, and multi-organ failure. All BUs had a significantly higher occurrence of bacterial pneumonia (39-50%) except the EBU (16%) which was significantly lower. The Eastern and Southern BUs (10 and 13%) had a significantly lower ARDS incidence, while the WBU (49%) was the highest. The Northern and the Central BUs were equal (33%). Table 3 illustrates the results of the LOS of four subsets of the sample in all the BUs. The mean range of the LOS in all the BUs for the four subsets was 10-14 days distributed as follows: ICU, 14; total sample 11.9; in-hospital deaths, 11.6; and transferred, 10.0. A one-way-ANOVA applied to the total sample suggested that there were statistically significant variations between BUs (p value < 0.0001), in which the Central and Western BUs were the highest, the Eastern and Southern had significantly lower LOSs. When the one-way-ANOVA was applied to the transferred patients it showed statistically significant variations between BUs (p value < 0.0001), in which the Central, Western, and Southern BUs had the highest LOS, and the Eastern had the lowest. There were no significant statistical variations in the LOS between BUs for ICU admissions or patients who died in hospital (p value > 0.05 for both).",

Compared to the inpatients admitted in the CBU and controlling for chronic diseases and complications, the estimated average LOS for inpatients admitted in the Eastern and Southern BUs were significantly shorter by 28% and 25 % days respectively (p value < 0.001). The NBU had relatively shorter LOS, while the WBU was associated with lengthier stays compared with the CBU, but without statistical significance (p value > 0.05 for both). Other variables having a significant association with longer LOS (compared to reference) were admission to ICU (50% longer LOS; p value < 0.0001) and age with a 4% longer LOS each year of increase in age (p value = 0.006). Other factors significantly associated with shorter LOSs (compared to the reference) were death during admission (61% shorter LOS), patients referred to other hospitals (24% shorter LOS), admitted with ARDS (13% shorter LOS), and being Saudi (9% shorter LOS). Table 5 , shows the results of a sensitivity analysis to perform an in-depth investigation into the differentials in LOS in the proposed five regional BUs. When modeling patient subsets, the results were similar in all models in which we compared the CBU to the other BUs. The Eastern and Southern BUs had significantly shorter LOSs than the CBU (p value < 0.05 for all of the models). Because the results are similar, we can conclude that the patient subsets are unlikely to bias the results obtained from using the entire sample.",

We included the analyses of three categories of patient characteristics in our study, demographics, comorbidities, and complications from COVID-19, to consider the factors that might be associated with LOS. The mean LOS for inpatients with COVID-19 in the KSA was almost 12 days. Our resultant mean LOS of 12 fell between that found in an extensive systematic review in which the mean LOS in China was 14 days and outside China was 5 days for inpatients in general hospitals (Rees et al., 2020) . The mean LOS for inpatients in the ICU in our study was 14 days; however, in a previous review, the LOS ranged from 5 to 19 days (Rosenbaum, 2020) . The difference in protocols for hospitalization and discharges and the extent of the pandemic between countries may account for such a wide range in the LOS of both for general hospital patients and ICU patients. We adjusted for known patient and disease severity characteristics that may have affected the length of stay among patients with COVID-19. After adjustment, compared to the CBU the Eastern and Southern BUs had significantly lower LOSs; although the NBU had a relatively lower LOS, it was statistically insignificant. Compared to the CBU, the WBU had a relatively higher, but statistically insignificant LOS. Our observation of a difference in LOS between BUs after the adjustments supports our hypothesis that there are variations in terms of quality in the provision of health services that are driven by factors other than patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Our findings of differences in the quality of care among the BUs is consistent with a study of ICU admissions among COVID-19 inpatients in the KSA which found variations in quality among the BUs (Alharbi et al., 2021) . These findings may be explained by hospital practices for patients with COVID-19; in terms of the relationship with region and LOS, using subsets of patients. Consider, for example, transferred patients. We observed that the EBU transferred patients to a second hospital at a significantly higher rate than other BUs, which may mean that they transferred patients with severe conditions to tertiary hospitals where more advanced treatment would be available. This disparity may have resulted from the variability of resources between BUs. However, our findings of a difference in LOS persisted when subsets of patients were eliminated.",

The evidence provided by our study regarding the differences in LOS among the future five BUs in the new MOC can guide policymakers in decisions relating to the provision of resources to help ensure equity in quality healthcare as the KSA moves forward with Vision 2030. As the private administration of each of the five BUs is implemented, the MOH will move to a greater supervision of the overall system and will need a rational basis for providing resources and guidance to the administrators to reduce the large variations in the quality of healthcare services shown in Fig. 2 .",

As our research is based on only three and a half months of MOH reporting during a period where variations reached the peak of cases among the 13 regions, we recommend conducting another study that uses data through December 2020. Moreover, our study did not explore the effect of level of care, i.e., insufficient, or excessive care. For example, does the number of staff involved lead to longer or shorter LOS; further study with an in-depth investigation on this may help understand the interplay between these factors.",

The study revealed significant differences in LOS between the BUs indicating quality of care disparities from region to region in descending order: Western, Central, Northern, Southern, and Eastern. The differences in the LOS persisted, even after adjustment for patient and disease factors. Therefore, reasons for the lower LOS duration in the EBU and SBU may relate to differences in human and physical infrastructure. These findings are valuable for implementing the new MOC of Vision 2030 in which one goal is to provide high quality, accessible, and equitable healthcare for all citizens.",
