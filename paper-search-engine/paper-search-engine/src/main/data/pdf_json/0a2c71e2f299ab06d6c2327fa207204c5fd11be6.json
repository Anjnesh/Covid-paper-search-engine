While fatigue mitigation is currently addressed by duty hour restrictions and education about fatigue, Fatigue Risk Management Systems (FRMSs) offer a more comprehensive strategy for addressing these issues. An important component of FRMS in other shiftwork industries, such as aviation and trucking, is the use of biomathematical models to prospectively identify fatigue risk in work schedules. Such an approach incorporates decades of knowledge of sleep and circadian rhythm research into shift schedules, taking into account not just duty hour restrictions but the temporal placement of work schedules. Recent research has shown that biomathematical models of fatigue can be adapted to a resident physician population and can help address fatigue risk. Such models do not require subject matter experts and can be applied in graduate medical education program shift scheduling. It is important for graduate medical education program providers to consider these alternative methods of fatigue mitigation. These tools can help reduce fatigue risk and may improve wellness as they allow for a more precise fatigue management strategy without reducing overall work hours.",

Administrations may tailor their FRMS to their specific operational environment. In industries such as aviation or rail, the systems developed by operators require approval by a regulatory body, such as the FAA. While the US has provided prescriptive limits on duty time for rail and aviation since the early 20th century, FRMS have evolved as sleep and fatigue science has expanded our understanding of the causes and consequences of fatigue-related impairment. 4 An FRMS complements prescriptive duty hours limits by using measures and estimates of actual performance to address fatigue and alertness. Agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), International Civil Aviation Organization, and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of Australia, have promoted the use of FRMS systems, with the FAA describing it as \"\u2026 a data driven and scientifically based process that allows for continuous monitoring and management of safety risks associated with fatigue-related error. It is part of a repeating performance improvement process. This process leads to continuous safety enhancements by identifying and addressing fatigue factors\u2026\" 5 FRMS use a variety of approaches including napping, rest facilities, rotating shifts, voluntary reporting of fatigue, and biomathematical models of fatigue to address fatigue risk both proactively and reactively. 6 While such systems are applied to other safety-sensitive industries such as aviation and railroad, they are not formally used in medical fields, which still use prescriptive limits on duty time.",

Mathematical models of sleep regulation assert that the timing of sleep arises from a combination of sleep pressure (or how long it has been since an individual last rested) and the circadian rhythm, ie, the body's estimate of time of day based on environmental cues like daylight. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Fatigue models take these factors into account to predict the restorative benefit of sleep opportunities within the context of time of day and work history. Several biomathematical models of fatigue exist and are commonly used in transportation and/or shiftwork industries. 7, 8, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] These models may differ with regard to their design, capabilities, or stated goals, but generally rely on work schedule data, circadian factors, and a model of sleep regulation to predict performance and alertness on the job. 6, 14 In contrast to duty-hour restrictions, fatigue modeling considers when work hours are scheduled in relation to time of day as well as proximity of a work shift to previous and subsequent work periods; this allows for the assessment of the cumulative effects of multiple days of sleep restriction.",

The FAA considers fatigue modeling as a component of an FRMS that \"incorporates the latest scientific research on human circadian systems, sleep, and performance capability, and can be useful for rapidly estimating fatigue levels associated with proposed new routes or schedule changes.\" 25, 26 Prospective fatigue modeling is also used in railroad operations and long-haul trucking. Research has shown fatigue models could accurately predict risk that was correlated with real-life human factors-related accidents. 16, 27 The Federal Railroad Association (FRA) now mandates hours of service rules for employees working in commuter rail and intercity rail transportation and requires some passenger train employees' work schedules to be analyzed with an FRA-approved fatigue model. 28 ",

While duty-hour requirements focus on the maximum number of hours that residents can work, they do not address the temporal placement of work within those limitations and fail to incorporate what we know about the circadian rhythm, the cumulative effects of sleep deprivation, and fatigue's effect on cognitive performance. In addition, highly fatiguing service lines could be interspersed with less strenuous ones in the year-long block rotation schedule, or shifting start and end times to maximize the benefits of nighttime sleep during a particular rotation.

            "text": "There are certain barriers and limitations that have prevented the implementation of FRMS in healthcare settings. First, manipulating schedules can often not be done in isolation and would likely require disruption at the department or even hospital level. However, many software programs that use fatigue modeling are well equipped for large-scale operations, like major airlines. Second, there is considerable emphasis in the graduate medical education field on substantial resident hours needed with patients for education -there may be resistance to reduction of hours. However, fatigue modeling can be beneficial in altering schedules in a way that does not reduce overall work hours. Finally, there are misrepresentations about the limitations of fatigue modeling in FRMS. Fatigue models are designed to predict a measure of alertness based on time asleep and awake, while incorporating information about time of day and circadian rhythms. However, they do not depend, at present, on workload. This is beneficial in that they can be used across different fields of work, but a limitation in that they do not account for differences in workload across these fields. Despite this limitation, the use of fatigue modeling can maximize performance based on non-workload factors, which can put an individual in a better position to do whatever their work type requires. For example, while a pilot and medical resident may have very different job requirements, both fields demand a high degree of cognitive capacity to handle job demands, and both fields require extensive simulator and real-world training to be licensed. An FRMS using modeling to guide duty scheduling will maximum alertness to meet those demanding cognitive job requirements. A final limitation includes uncertainty about the estimated sleep patterns that performance predictions are based on. While average performance can be predicted using estimated sleep (a parametrized estimator based on shift worker sleep can do this), or actual sleep from a sample population, the estimate may not be accurate for each individual, if, for example, the individual's sleep is unexpectedly disrupted. Modeling estimates should, therefore, be understood to be probabilistic risk assessments, not definitive predictions of individual performance. Nevertheless, sleep estimates can be guided by actual sleep measurements so that, on average, the predictions are accurate.",

These articles by Schwartz et al 40, 41 and Devine et al 42 demonstrate the utility of fatigue modeling to identify areas of fatigue risk and evaluate how schedule changes could impact fatigue and performance. Devine et al, characterized the trends and patterns in medical resident sleep using actigraph-collected sleep data over two months. From this, they were able to determine how and when residents slept and when and for how long they napped. Both Schwartz et al papers modeled resident schedules to assess their performance based on when and how long they worked. However, in the second paper, 41 they used the exact sleep data from Devine et al to adjust the model so that estimated sleep closely matched actual resident sleep. Performance data will best represent residents when it is based off of estimated sleep times closely matched to actual sleep times. In sum, the fatigue model used was able to closely predict the sleep patterns of general surgery residents and help estimate the level of fatigue risk across multiple schedules.",

Measurement of sleep patterns, wellbeing, and relevant performance metrics could be compared between residents working on the original and mitigated schedules.
