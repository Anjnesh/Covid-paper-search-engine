Sedentary behaviors have been defined as those activities whose energy expenditure is \ufffd1.5 metabolic equivalent (METs), while in seated, reclined or lying posture [8] . Sitting time is the most common sedentary behavior. Several studies have described that prolonged time in sedentary behaviors might increase the incidence and mortality of many chronic diseases, independent of total reported physical activity [7, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The available evidence suggests that total sitting time per day has increased in the last years [15] . Furthermore, prolonged sitting time has been observed in men, people within the higher income level [15] , and those in the highest BMI category [15] . Although, there is not a global cut-off point to estimate the prevalence of high sitting time in adults, most of the recently published studies have used the highest quartile ranging from 7 to more than 8 hours per day [16] [17] [18] .",

This could be explained by the fact that women and older adults [31] are involved in light intensity physical activity mainly performed within leisure or home-related activities [32] and adults classified as underweight or obese could have decreased levels of physical activity and an increased sedentarism [33, 34] . In addition, the lack of frequently use of places for physical activity by Mexican women could be another reason [29] . Even though the sitting time prevalence has increased in the last 12 years in Mexico, this prevalence is lower than that reported in other countries [16] . For instance, data from the US reported that the prevalence of high sitting time was 25.7% in adults [16] and 18.5% in the European Union [18] compared to the 11.3% reported in this study. Discrepancies could be related to the high sitting time cut-off point [16, 18] . Until now there is not an official cut-off point for sedentary behaviors, however, some authors have reported that spending 7-8 hours per day sitting could be detrimental for health [17, 35] .",

This could be related to the fact that people in these groups spent more time in sedentary occupations such as industries, office works and schools. Men, younger adults, those living in urban areas, people within the medium and high SES and within the highest educational levels were more likely to not meet physical activity recommendations and have high sitting time. Similar results have been observed in a previous study that estimated the association of high sitting (\ufffd7.5 hour per day)/less active physical activity (0-5 days) using the IPAQ [37] . However, some differences have been reported in a European study that used accelerometers and higher sitting time cut-off points (>10 hours per day) [38] . As shown in previous studies [37] , similar groups with higher ORs of being high sitters [17] are also at risk of being classified as sedentary/non-active. Thus, caution should be taken in these groups because previous evidence has shown that high sitting time (\ufffd4 h/d) is associated with all-cause [39, 40] and cardiovascular mortality [39] in the least active group (<150 minutes/week).",

Physical activity and sitting time were measured using IPAQ short, not allowing to differentiate physical activity in the four domains in which it is performed (occupational, house, commuting and leisure time) and limiting the ability to inform domain-specific physical activity promotion policies and strategies. Self-reported measures could over and underestimate, respectively. Adjustment of physical activity levels with an equation developed for Mexican population may attenuate the overestimation of physical activity [6] . However, there is no similar procedure to adjust IPAQ self-reported sitting time estimates. Due to study design, causal association between physical activity and sociodemographic characteristics cannot be inferred.",
