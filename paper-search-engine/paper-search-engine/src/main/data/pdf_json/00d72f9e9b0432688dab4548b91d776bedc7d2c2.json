However, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f QAT sensitivity in the late stage was lower than in the early stage, with a declined correlation coefficient.

In the current study, we have presented a cutoff to determine whether the patient is within 10 days or later after onset, and it seems reasonable that our cutoff is higher than that for the positivity criterion. In addition, in the time-course of antigen levels shown by Aoki et al., only one sample fell below our cutoff within 10 days from onset, and this sample had also been judged negative for QAT by the authors.

            "text": "Previous studies have suggested that RAT is a potentially superior predictor of viral culture results to RT-qPCR. Pekosz et al. found concordance between SARS-CoV-2 VeroE6 TMPRSS2 culture, RT-qPCR, and rapid antigen testing and revealed that RAT had a higher positive predictive value than RT-qPCR (90% vs. 70%) [6] . Kohmer et al. reported that the antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic test correlated better with cell culture infectivity in vitro than RT-qPCR (61.8%-82.4% vs 51.6%) [7] . Our previous study also implied the utility of qualitative antigen testing in predicting the appropriate duration of quarantine [16] . Qualitative antigen tests generally tend to be less sensitive, and false-negative results in contagious patients have been a challenge. In contrast, Lumipulse \u00ae SARS-CoV-2 Ag allows quantitative evaluation of antigens, which may minimize the problem of false negatives in the early stages of infection. In addition, this test may be used to differentiate contagious patients by setting a value other than the original cutoff for a positive result.",

Even testing with suboptimal accuracy, such as rapid antigen testing, can be useful in situations where a pandemic is spreading rapidly. Mathematical models showed that frequent testing and strict isolation of patients using RATs could contribute to pandemic control at justifiable cost by reducing local transmission of the virus and its mortality [17, 18] . Although RT-PCR is a diagnostic method with high sensitivity and specificity, it requires more financial and human resources. Other convenient diagnostic methods could ensure efficient use of limited resources. QAT, with its relatively high diagnostic accuracy, might contribute to the control of the current pandemic.",

However, long-term shedding of the infectious virus has been reported in severe disease and immunocompromised cases [19, 20] . These specific cases should be considered separately from our study. Second, although viral culture serves as a surrogate marker of viral infectivity, we did not perform viral culture in our study. Therefore, we lack a strict determination of infectivity for individual cases. Discontinuation of isolation using our cutoff requires caution, and its use may be limited to cases with mild-to-moderate disease.",

The sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence intervals [CI]) with RT-qPCR results were calculated for the early (up to 10 days after onset) and late (over 10 days after onset) stages. The validity of the results was examined using Cohen's kappa and Gwet's AC1 statistic (AC1). Time-series changes in antigen levels and RT-qPCR results were displayed as the locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) curve, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted with the cutoff value defined as the least distance from the top-left corner of the box. Match-rate and time-series analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All other analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics (version 26; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, was conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki after receiving ethical review approval from the Ethics Committee of the NCGM (NCGM-G-003586-00). A total of 100 specimens were obtained from confirmed COVID-19 patients, including 51 early-phase and 49 late-stage specimens, with a median time from onset (interquartile range) of 8 (6-9) and 16 (13-19) days, respectively. There were 77 mild cases (no oxygen demand), 14 moderate cases (oxygen in demand except for ventilator), and 9 severe cases (ventilator in demand). The majority of patients were immunocompetent except for one case of metastatic cancer and three cases of human immunodeficiency virus infection in mild disease and two cases of solid organ transplantation in severe disease. The antiviral agents used were Hydroxychloroquine (32 cases; 18 mild, 6 moderate, and 8 severe), inhaled Ciclesonide (11 cases; 10 mild and 1 moderate), Favipiravir (6 cases; 3 mild and 3 moderate), and Lopinavir-Ritonavir (1 moderate case). Among the collected VTM specimens, 70 of 100 specimens were positive, while 30 were negative, as determined by the NIID assay. Of these negative specimens, 10 were confirmed positive by the Takara assay, resulting in 80 positive and 20 negative specimens by RT-qPCR. For all specimens, QAT sensitivity and specificity was used to compare QAT and RT-qPCR along the time series (Figure 1). The correlation coefficients between QAT and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all periods, in the early stage, and in the late stage were 0.883, 0.882, and 0.794, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1). The ROC analysis for samples in all periods indicated that the most appropriate cutoff value to distinguish early-phase from latestage specimens was 6.93 pg/mL (Figure 2). Using new cutoff values, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for predicting the late stage was 0.75 (0.61-0.86), 0.76 (0.62-0.87), 0.75 (0.61-0.86), and 0.76 (0.62-0.87), respectively.",
