The least were perspectives, consensus, images, and photo assay with [1 (0.43%)] each. The maximum publications were in July [44 (19.05%)] and least in April [1 (0.43%)]. Considering specialty, the maximum articles were related to general ophthalmology [124 (53.68%)] and least were in refractive surgery and community ophthalmology with [1 (0.43%)] each. The maximum citations were for original articles [352 (34.65%)], which was 2.3 times higher than review articles and letters to editor [150 (14.76%)]. General ophthalmology had 740 (72.83%) citations, which were nearly five times that of cornea [140 (13.78%)]. Conclusion: The IJO showed a trough and crest pattern of COVID-19 publications month wise. Letter to editor and general ophthalmology COVID-19 articles had maximum publications with maximum citations for general ophthalmology owing to practice patterns and COVID-19 challenges.",

            "text": "Last year the world saw the emergence of a novel deadly infectious virus called coronavirus disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2). [1] On December 31, 2019, China reported the first cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology detected in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China. [2] Due to an unprecedented and exponential surge in COVID-19 cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized it as a health emergency and declared it a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 . [3] The Indian government announced a nation-wide lockdown on March 24, 2020 with around 500 positive cases, limiting the movement of people to control the infection. [4] The COVID-19 pandemic saw a tremendous increase in submission and publication rate in all ophthalmology journals. [5] The pandemic can be labelled as \"infodemic of publications.\" There was a huge upsurge in COVID-19 articles throughout the year [6] and Indian Journal of Ophthalmology (IJO) was not far behind to meet the challenge of quick and expedited quality COVID-19 publications. The IJO is open access, indexed, peer-reviewed monthly published journal by the All India Ophthalmic Society (AIOS). [7] It publishes scientific and clinical articles in the field of ophthalmology under the terms of Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial Share Alike 4.0 licenses. [8] The field of study that concerns with measuring and analyzing scholarly literature is labelled as scientometrics. [9] Scientometrics is a subfield of bibliometrics. It deals with the impact of scholarly research manuscripts and academic journals, in-depth analysis of scientific citations, and the utilization of such measurements in policy and management contexts. [10] Yu et al. [9] in their analysis highlighted that the number of ophthalmology papers increased from 7450 to 9089 during 2007-2017 with an annual increase of 2.2%. Mansour et al. [11] in their literature analysis highlighted that the journal impact factor rose steadily around 10% annually in ophthalmic journals and was well correlated with recent bibliometric indicators like 5-year impact, H index, and SCImago factor but not with eigenfactor. During the course of time, a large numbers of manuscripts have been published detailing the scientometrics of published literature in various specialities including ophthalmology. The Scientometrics analysis related to specific ocular pathologies like glaucoma, [12] cornea and refractive surgery, [13] age-related macular disease, [14] vitreoretinal diseases, [15] and published literature in IJO [8] is already available. After a detailed literature review and to the best of our knowledge, none of the previously published articles have done an intricate scientometric analysis of COVID-19 literature published in IJO during the pandemic. Through this article, we have aimed to highlight the comprehensive scientometric analysis and citation trend of COVID-19 literature published in IJO during the pandemic from April 2020 (post lockdown) to May 2021. This article also highlights the total number of COVID-19 articles published, speciality-wise contribution and correlation, month-wise split-up of COVID-19 articles, citation analysis, and percentage growth rate.",

The study complied with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study did not involve the study participants; hence, the study approval was not obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Institutional Ethical Committee. The bibliographic records were obtained from the official website of IJO and were reconfirmed from Editor IJO's personal monthly email and PubMed search engine. The data collected was then exported as XML into Microsoft access for scientometric analysis. The articles were segregated as Original articles, Review articles, Case Report/Series, Letter to the Editor/Commentary, Guest Editorial, PointCounterpoint, Consensus Criteria, Ophthalmic Images, Photo Essay, Surgical Techniques, and AIOS Meeting Papers. The data was comprehensively analyzed for specialty wise correlations, distribution, citation trend, and reasons for the same. All major articles with a heading of a clinical study or trial, comparative study, brief communication, controlled clinical trial, journal article, and randomized controlled trial were categorized as original articles. The total data was listed in tabular format. Table 1 depicts all related articles published monthwise during the study period. Table 2 is a comprehensive analysis of the subspecialty-wise distribution of COVID-19 articles during the pandemic. Table 3 describes the subject-wise distribution of COVID-19-related articles during the pandemic. Further, Table 4 is an in-depth subject-wise citation count of COVID-19 articles during the pandemic.

Despite lockdown, COVID-19 challenges, multiple hurdles, and reduction in potential volume, the Indian authors never looked back and contributed evidence-based original articles to the global world. The commentaries and editorials published by the respected Editor IJO, and stalwarts of Indian Ophthalmology opened channels for deeper insight and a better understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on clinical ophthalmology with their expert inputs. The least were perspectives, [24] consensus criteria, [25] ophthalmic images, [26] and photo assay [27] with 1 (0.43%) each. The main reasons behind this could be a lack of definitive corelating evidence with COVID-19 or a chance finding. The images and photoassay contribution was least probably due to fear of transmission of COVID-19, while evaluating and capturing images and also because most of the ophthalmology centers were not dealing with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 patients directly.",

The ratio of general ophthalmology to cornea was 3.5:1, and general ophthalmology to retina was 4.8:1, and general ophthalmology to pediatrics was 7.7:1. Teleophthalmology was a new renaissance and great boon owing to COVID-19 practices and challenges. All the teleophthalmology [33] related articles have been listed under general ophthalmology. The probable reasons for maximum general ophthalmology publications were sharing of general consensus guidelines by AIOS, sanitization and safe practices, sterilization and operation theater surgical protocols, teleconsultation, and standard operating COVID-19 practices at various centers. The least number of publications were in cataract and IOL [34] and oncology [27] with 3 (1.30%) and 2 (0.86%), respectively, and refractive surgery [35] and community ophthalmology [36] with 1 (0.43%) each. The reason being that elective surgeries and community screening in form of camps were at halt for the major part of the year. Surprisingly, two articles were published related to oncology in the form of practice patterns [37] and a case report of COVID-19 related to chronic myeloid leukaemia.

These zigzag patterns showed that there was not only a figurative jump in the number of COVID-19-related submissions, but at the same time, the journal editors and reviewers made sure to publish quality research at expedited rates than normal. [48] This was the need of the time and valuable timely research publications have been instrumental in guiding ophthalmologists worldwide in restarting and making appropriate modifications in their clinics and examination approaches to deal with the pandemic safely. The highest growth rate of publications was witnessed in May 2020 with a jump of 1300% due to a sudden hike by publications of 13 articles. This was obvious because of the lockdown and sudden shutdown of hospitals in late March, which triggered the senior ophthalmologists to lay guidelines and protocols for all the ophthalmologists countrywide. IJO being the highly reputed ophthalmic national journal was chosen as the way of reaching every ophthalmologists clinic/hospital, which did wonders in few days which can be evidenced by higher citations of the early published work not in national but international journals as well. A similar trend continued over subsequent months as we saw a 100% growth rate in July 2020, 78.57% in March 2021, and 62.5% in May 2021.

The strengths of our study are the unique detailed analysis of published COVID-19 literature during the pandemic, comprehensive scientometric specialty wise analysis along with detailed citation analysis. We have not included citations from any pre prints or citations received after April 10, 2021. However, the total number of COVID-19 articles will remain static, but citation being a dynamic process is expected to increase in future. We hope that IJO will receive an exponential surge in citations under the leadership of intellectual leaders including the respected editor, especially for COVID-19 articles, and this will automatically enhance the impact factor of the only ophthalmic national journal.",

A total of 231 COVID-19 article were published, out of which letter to editor and general ophthalmology COVID-19 articles had maximum publications with maximum citations for general ophthalmology owing to practice patterns and COVID-19 challenges. The maximum article were published in July 2020 and maximum citations were original article. General ophthalmology articles has 740 citations which was 5 times of that of cornea articles.
