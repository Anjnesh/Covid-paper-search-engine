Although group testing can help to significantly increase testing capabilities, the (repeated) testing of entire populations can exceed the resources of any country. We thus propose an extension of the theory of group testing that takes into account the fact that definitely specifying the infection status of each individual is impossible. Our theory builds on assigning to each individual an infection status (healthy/infected), as well as an associated cost function for erroneous assignments. This cost function is versatile, e.g., it could take into account that false negative assignments are worse than false positive assignments and that false assignments in critical areas, such as health care workers, are more severe than in the general population. Based on this model, we study the optimal use of a limited number of tests to minimize the expected cost. More specifically, we utilize information-theoretic methods to give a lower bound on the expected cost and describe simple strategies that can significantly reduce the expected cost over currently known strategies. A detailed example is provided to illustrate our theory.",

Probabilistic group testing is in contrast to combinatorial group testing [2, 3] where one assumes a fixed known number of infected individuals. Furthermore, we assume that while the number of tests is limited, all tests are perfectly accurate. Although the case of imprecise tests also leads to interesting resource allocation problems [4] , we will not consider it in this work. Thus, if none of the individuals in a tested group are infected, the test will yield a negative result with certainty and one test was sufficient to obtain a definite result for several individuals. If, however, the test is positive, one cannot say which individuals in the group are infected and further tests have to be conducted.",

Although this strategy is far from optimal, it is easy to implement and can significantly increase the testing capabilities, compared to testing every sample individually. Further research in this direction was focused on finding new, more efficient and practical testing strategies, e.g., nested testing [6] , binary splitting [7] , and array testing [8] . The binary splitting algorithms by Hwang [7] perform close to the theoretic optimum, within a factor of 1.11 of an information-theoretic lower bound, as shown by Aldridge [9] . However, such a binary splitting technique requires extensive bookkeeping and many tests need to be performed sequentially, and cannot be conducted in parallel. Simpler, two-stage procedures are investigated by Berger and Levenshtein [10] . The close relation of adaptive, probabilistic group testing to variable length source coding is well-detailed by Wolf [11] .",

            "text": "The common ground of all works above is that they focus on identifying exactly, which individuals are infected. This is a valid strategy and clearly the best outcome. However, there can be situations where not sufficiently many tests are available to subject all potentially infected individuals to a test. This is particularly the case when many individuals are (potentially) infected and testing resources are scarce. Here, a strategy needs to be found that uses these limited resources effectively. When insufficient tests for the entire population are available, it is unavoidable that some healthy individuals will be treated as infected and/or some infected individuals treated as healthy. For the design of a testing strategy, it is important to note, that these two events are not equally harmful in general. It might be considerably worse to have an undetected infection (false negative) present, than to treat one healthy individual as infected (false positive). A suitable balance has to be found and sensitive questions like \"How many false positives are we willing to accept to prevent one false negative?\" need to be answered to do so. Here, assuming that quantitative answers to these questions can be given, we propose a framework for designing and evaluating group testing strategies. Mathematically, the resulting problem is one of rate-distortion theory, a branch of information theory, established in the 1950s in a seminal paper by Shannon [20] . This connection allows us to formulate bounds on the performance of any group testing strategy. Although the problem of (combinatorial) group testing was extensively explored by information-theorists (e.g., in Ch. 24-29 in Aydinian et al. [21] and by Aldridge et al. [5] ), this rate-distortion viewpoint has apparently not been considered so far. Thus, fundamental bounds are missing even for elementary scenarios.",

Since we are usually concerned with large N , we ignore these terms in this and the following testing strategies. Of course, 1SG(u 1 ) can be further extended by testing those individuals again, that belong to a positively tested group of size u 1 . Specifically, we can separate the group into disjoint subgroups of smaller size u 2 and subject these subgroups again to a group test. This two stage group testing (2SG) strategy is a generalization of Dorfman testing [1] which corresponds to the case u 2 = 1, i.e., each individual in a positive group is tested separately. The decision strategy remains the same as in 1SG: Those individuals that belong to a positively tested subgroup (of size u 2 ) are declared infected. We again designate the group sizes in parenthesis, e.g., 2SG(50, 10) for a group size of 50 individuals that is divided into five subgroups of 10 individuals each, if the first group test is positive.

We consider the setting p = 0.01, b = 1, and c = a = 50, i.e., we assume that we have a prevalence of 1% and a false negative is fifty times worse than a false positive assignment. We begin with some trivial observations. First, if we do not have any tests available, the best strategy is to assign everyone to be healthy. This is because the expected cost of declaring an individual healthy is E \u03c1(X n , 0) = p \u00b7 a + (1 \u2212 p) \u00b7 0 = 0.5, while the expected cost for declaring someone infected is E \u03c1(X n , 1) = p \u00b7 0 + (1 \u2212 p) \u00b7 1 = 0.99. On the other extreme is the case of zero cost, i.e., to determine exactly which individuals are infected. Here, clearly individual testing at a rate of 1 TpI could be applied, but Theorem 2 in Aldridge [9] shows that it is also possible using a binary splitting algorithm at a rate of 0.0855 TpI. Any rate-cost tradeoff between these extreme points can be achieved by applying the available tests to as many individuals as possible, while declaring all others as healthy by default. Unfortunately, using approaches like a binary splitting algorithm do not come without problems: There is a significant amount of bookkeeping required and individuals usually have to be tested many times in a row delaying the notification about the result. Shifting to the strategies 1SG and 2SG that do not aim at identifying the status of each individual but to minimize the overall expected cost can lead to simpler procedures and better performance at the same time. Our lower bound in Theorem 3.1, the binary splitting algorithm, and the strategies 1SG and 2SG, as well as individual testing, for comparison, are illustrated in Figure 1 . Note, that for all strategies, one can always subject only part of the individuals to a test and simply declare the rest healthy. In particular, we see that the optimal 2SG strategy when tests are scarce (less than 0.037 TpI) is to use the testing strategy 2SG(66, 22) for as many individuals as possible, outperforming the binary splitting approach.",

Thus, an additional expected number of 2 124 712 individuals would be considered infected in this subpopulation. In total, an expected number of 2 228 333 individuals would be considered infected. We see that the decrease in expected cost is very limited with such a low number of tests, even if an optimized strategy is used. In particular, our lower bound shows that no strategy can reduce the expected cost below 0.609 using the assumed 103 621 tests. However, our theory can also be used to estimate how many tests are required to achieve a certain reduction in expected cost. For example, we can find the number of tests necessary to obtain half the expected cost than without testing, i.e., 0.478. Our lower bound shows that at least 0.0226 TpI (201 256 tests in total) are necessary, while our optimized strategies show that 0.0419 TpI (373 636 tests in total) are sufficient. Our optimized strategies suggest to use a 1SG(4) strategy to test all individuals in subpopulation one and a mix of 1SG(24) and 1SG (23) strategies to test all individuals in subpopulation four. We also want to point out that an astonishing number of 0.499 TpI (4 447 461 tests in total) would be required to achieve the same goal with individual testing; and even the previously best known binary splitting testing strategies require 0.102 TpI (909 637 tests in total).",

Here, non-adaptive group testing may be easier to analyze because the encoder is essentially restricted to the max( \u00b7 ) function. Another direction for future work is to incorporate testing errors, resulting in a joint source-channel coding scenario. It is not clear whether the source-channel separation theorem holds in this case. Nevertheless, we expect that a lower bound similar to the one presented here can be obtained, by adding the additional bits (i.e., tests) necessary for error-free communication over a binary (most likely asymmetric) channel.",

This enables us to use only very few parameters that describe a current pandemic situation and we do not require any detailed personal information such as contact maps between individuals. However, even these few parameters can be difficult to estimate and may also result in ethical challenges. The prevalence p is the easiest and most obvious parameter and can be estimated using a negligible number of tests for a pilot study and the estimate can be improved as the testing strategy is applied. The costs b and c of wrong assignments are more difficult to choose. They can be adapted to the infectiousness of the disease, the cost and effectiveness of quarantine, non-pharmaceutical interventions that reduce the risk of infection, and most likely many more variables. How to exactly choose these costs is beyond the scope of our work and very specific for a given situation. It may also include political decisions by weighing health factors (e.g., minimize the number of infections by quarantining many individuals) against economic factors (e.g., minimize the number of quarantined individuals). Note however that at least implicitly these costs are used in political decisions: A society-wide lockdown can be interpreted as the assertion, that assigning all (untested) individuals an infected status is less costly than considering them to be healthy. Thus, at a prevalence p, this implies (1 \u2212 p)b \u2264 pc.",

First, an established statement is that group testing is beneficial exactly in the regime p < 1 2 (3 \u2212 \u221a 5) \u2248 0.381 [23] , i.e., in this regime, group testing cannot outperform individual testing. However, this result was proven under the assumption that perfect identification of the infection status of each individual is required. Maybe surprisingly, this statement does not extend to our setting. Indeed, for the specific case of p = 1 2 (3 \u2212 \u221a 5), b = 1, and c = 10, using the testing strategy 1SG(2) has a strictly lower expected cost than individually testing every second individual (both have rate 1/2 TpI). Similarly, in the nonadaptive regime (i.e., all tests are performed in parallel) an established result is that individual testing is optimal if all individuals are independent and have a fixed prevalence p [34] . Again, this result only holds if perfect identification of the infection status of each individual is required. In our setting, the simple 1SG testing strategy is a non-adaptive strategy and is clearly superior to individual testing (see Figure 1 ).",
