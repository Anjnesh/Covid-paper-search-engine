Annual panel data from 1996 to 2018 are examined using the Pedroni panel cointegration test in order to check the existence of a long-run relationship; FMOLS, DOLS, and the VECM techniques to detect the causality direction. The following findings are established. First, in the long run, infectious diseases are more destructive on economic growth in developing countries than in developed countries. Second, infectious diseases have a negative and significant influence on the trade openness, but more intensively in developed countries than in developing countries. Finally, using the VEC model, our results demonstrate that the short run causality between diseases, economic growth, and trade openness is unidirectional running from infectious diseases to trade and economic growth. However, in the long run, there is bidirectional Granger causality among the running variables. Based on these results, government makers should concentrate more on the healthcare delivery in order to realize higher rates of economic growth and trade.",

Second, previous studies have not looked at the impact of infectious diseases on trade openness. In the context, only Kambou et al. (1993) examined the impact of HIV on exports. In this case, I examine the influence of diseases on trade openness. Third, to our knowledge, the study is the first to establish the long-term and short-term causality using the VECM model.",

Generally, good health has, on the one hand, a positive effect on the supply of productive labor and therefore higher incomes (Bloom et al., 2020) . On the other hand, good health can increase high life expectancy and decrease morbidity which can increase schooling and therefore the accumulation of human capital (Bleakley, 2007 (Bleakley, , 2010 Boucekkine et al., 2002a, b; Cervellati & Sunde, 2005) . Also, health positively affects savings and investment (Alsan et al., 2006; Bloom et al., 2007) . Similarly, health implies a decline in fertility due to a decline in precautionary fertility and higher opportunity costs for children, which can then trigger a take-off in investments in education and the emergence of a demographic dividend (Bloom et al., 2017 (Bloom et al., , 2020 Cervellati & Sunde, 2011; Klasing & Milionis, 2020) .",

In addition, using a cross-section growth framework in sub-Saharan Africa, McCarthy et al.

In addition, Suhrcke and Urban (2010) showed a negative effect of cardiovascular diseases on subsequent economic growth in high-income countries over the period 1960-2000. Also, Garthwaite (2012) shows that restricted access to innovative pharmaceutical pain relief has led to a reduction in US labor supply. Bloom et al. (2003) showed that mortality reductions has a positive effect on labor supply, saving and investment in physical capital, especially in developing countries. In the same way, Boucekkine et al. (2002a, b) confirmed that mortality reductions increase the return to educational investments. Besides, Field et al. (2009) and Luca et al.

This positive relationship can be explained by the fact that in period of HIV/AIDS, the number of deaths increases, so the population decreases, then the per capita consumption rises. In the same way, Bureau for Economic Research (2006) showed the positive relationship between AIDS and real per capita GDP growth.

            "text": "Infectious diseases in country can be measured by different measures such as the number of people affected by the disease and also by the number of deaths caused by disease. In fact, counting the people with disease and the number of deaths caused by diseases is an important basic measure of disease frequency that is essential to detecting trends or the sudden occurrence of a problem, such as an epidemic. Simple counts of the number of diseased people are also important to public health planners and policy makers for assessing the need for resources in a population. Also, when measuring disease frequency, proportions and rates are very helpful when comparing groups, because they relate the number of people with disease to the size of the population in which they occur. Prevalence and incidence are the two fundamental measures of disease frequency.",
