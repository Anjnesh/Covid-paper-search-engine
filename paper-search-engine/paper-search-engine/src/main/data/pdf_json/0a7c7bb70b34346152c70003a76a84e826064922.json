The findings help to identify people who have difficulty accessing healthcare services during a pandemic situation. Design We conducted a cross-sectional study using a proportionate quota sampling method according to five major districts, sex and age, using an online survey. We analysed the key characteristics of influencing factors of unmet healthcare needs based on the Andersen behavioural model of healthcare utilisation: predisposing factors (eg, sex, age), need factors (eg, health status, illness) and enabling factors (eg, income, efficacy belief). Setting The questionnaire was sent via email and mobile text messages from the end of April to the beginning of May 2020 during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants A sample of 813 respondents was used, and the respondent information was anonymised in the analysis process. Results For the predisposing factors, sex, age, education level and occupational cluster were associated with unmet needs for healthcare. Chronic diseases and mental health were the influencing factors as an enabling factor that exerted an influence on the unmet need for healthcare in South Korea. Women, younger persons, those with lower education and persons with white-collar jobs were more likely to experience unmet healthcare needs. In addition, the more chronic diseases people had, the more COVID-19 negatively affected them mentally; and the more people felt fear of COVID-19, the higher chances they experienced unmet healthcare needs. Conclusion Government and policymakers are guided to draw out measures such as health communication and telemedicine to reduce the unmet healthcare needs during the pandemic and to recognise the different influencing factors.",

The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on 20 January 2020 in South Korea. In response to the rapid spread, the Korean government raised the infectious disease crisis emergency steps from 'warning' to 'alert'. The Seoul Metropolitan government commenced a 'Social Distancing Campaign' to contain the spread of the virus. Citizens in Seoul were recommended to avoid physical contact, refrain from going outdoors, maintain personal hygiene and wear a mask in public places. 1 According to previous studies, social distancing measures, such as avoiding visits to crowded places and hospitals, adversely impacted people's daily lives and led to even more negative social consequences and risks. 2 Hospitals are avoided by the general public due to the fear of getting infected, as was evident during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic. 2 Such behaviour leads to unmet healthcare needs, also referred to as unmet medical care, that is, when people cannot use healthcare services even if they want to. Unmet medical care causes deteriorating health status, and thus using healthcare services on time is critical. In particular, the experience of unmet medical care can be a serious threat to health for those with chronic diseases that require continuous medical attention.",

During the SARS pandemic, women were more likely to show avoidance behaviours or signs of emotional distress. 15 Our study results showed that as age increased, the rate of unmet medical care decreased. However, the elderly tended to avoid medical services due to the awareness of high risks in the COVID-19 situation.

Moreover, compared with old people, the unmet medical care of young people was associated with economic reasons or time costs, as they had to work to earn their living.

However, due to the situation of high uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic, relatively healthy young people may have reduced availing non-essential medical services. Moreover, compared with old people, the unmet medical care of young people was associated with economic reasons or time costs, as they had to work to earn their living. In other words, young adults voluntarily underused healthcare services to avoid time cost, and old people passively did so, owing to low income or recommendations for postponement from doctors. Even though unmet medical care occurred in all age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic, it seemed that the extent of underutilisation of healthcare services among young people was greater. ",

            "text": "Additionally, the study results regarding the education level were consistent with previous studies indicating the association between education level and unmet medical care. [17] [18] [19] Cumulative studies indicate that education level has disproportionate influences on healthcare utilisation, where education is generally related to health behaviour or attitudes. 18 19 In other words, people with lower education levels were more likely to experience unmet healthcare needs due to limited knowledge and illiteracy. Illiteracy was especially positively associated with mortality and transmissibility, likely contributing to lower access to medical care as well as decreased awareness and adoption of interventions proposed by public health officials, which increases the risk of infection and poor clinical outcomes. 17 20 Regarding occupational clusters, economically inactive populations, such as homemakers and retired or unemployed people, experienced unmet medical care less frequently than white-collar workers. This is possible since the economically inactive populations had more time to use healthcare services than white-collar people who were unable to go to clinics or hospitals due to time costs.",
