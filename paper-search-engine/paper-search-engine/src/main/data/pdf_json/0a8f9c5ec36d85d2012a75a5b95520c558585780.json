Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of pancreatic autopsy tissue from COVID-19 patients using immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, RNA scope and electron microscopy and detected SARS-CoV-2 viral infiltration of beta-cells in all patients. Using SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, we confirmed that isolated human islet cells are permissive to infection. In eleven COVID-19 patients, we examined the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS and other receptors and factors, such as DPP4, HMBG1 and NRP1, that might facilitate virus entry. Whereas 70% of the COVID-19 patients expressed ACE2 in the vasculature, only 30% displayed ACE2-expression in beta-cells. Even in the absence of manifest new-onset diabetes, necroptotic cell death, immune cell infiltration and SARS-CoV-2 viral infection of pancreatic beta-cells may contribute to varying degrees of metabolic dysregulation in patients with COVID-19.",

Diabetes and hyperglycemia are associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19. Furthermore, obesity, hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, and cardiovascular disorders as common comorbidities of diabetes are connected to adverse outcomes of COVID-19 3 . Conversely, new-onset hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, diabetes, and severe metabolic complications of pre-existing diabetes have been observed in patients suffering from COVID-19 [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Besides single reports of COVID-19 potentially causing or triggering new-onset diabetes 8, 10 , this phenomenon is currently analyzed in a newly established systematic registry (http://covidiab.e-dendrite. com/) 11 . It has been shown that human pancreatic alpha and beta-cells derived from pluripotent stem cells may be permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection 12 , and that SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect and replicate in human cells of the endocrine and exocrine pancreas 13 . Moreover, it has been suggested that coronavirus infiltration in the pancreas may have led to islet damage and acute diabetes in the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 14 . For COVID-19 patients, a better outcome is observed when a good glycemic control is maintained 15 . Therefore, it has been suggested that ACE2 imbalance in the pancreas causes acute beta-cell dysfunction and a resultant hyperglycemic state 16 . Furthermore, the expression of ACE2 has been shown to be increased upon inflammatory stress suggesting an enhancement of the beta-cell sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 during inflammatory conditions 17 . Acute pancreatitis following COVID-19 has also been reported 18 .",

To investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 infect pancreatic cells, we examined pancreas autopsies from 20 deceased COVID-19 patients from three different centers in Germany and Russia. As the tissues were from autopsies, they showed varying degrees of autolysis due to prolonged time before autopsy. In the study, we only included tissue, where an easy identification of islets based on H&E stainings ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ) and/or insulin staining was possible. Thereby, 11 patients were selected for further analysis. Six (55%) patients were male, and the patients' age groups ranged from 40 to 75 years. For ten of the patients, their BMI was known. Two patients exhibited normal weight (BMI 18.5-25 kg/m 2 ), four patients were affected by overweight (BMI 25-30 kg/m 2 ), and four patients by obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m 2 ), two of which had class 3 obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m 2 ). One of eleven COVID-19 patients (patient #8) was previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes ( Table 1) . As controls, we included autopsy tissues from non-COVID-19 and septic patients.

However, a small percentage of impaired islets were also detectable. This damage was noticed at varying degrees, and also in patients without previously diagnosed diabetes ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). In three COVID-19 patients (#5, #7, and #8), an increase in their blood glucose to more than 200 mg/dL from admission to shortly before they died was observed (Table 1) . These three patients were treated with steroids, which are known to induce hyperglycemia in patients already exhibiting a risk of developing diabetes, such as a family history of diabetes, increased age, and obesity 23 . COVID-19 patient #8 was already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and #5 had class 3 obesity, meaning that in these two cases, the observed hyperglycemia may at least partly be due by the glucocorticoid treatment. However, COVID-19 patient #7 and an additional patient (#1), also treated with steroids, who showed an increase in his arterial blood glucose to 162 mg/dL, were not at an increased risk of developing diabetes before their infection with SARS-CoV-2. This might implicate that the infection have led to hyperglycemia in these patients. In a recent study, the blood glucose in patients with COVID-19 was investigated, and it was found that in those patients having blood glucose levels >7.0 mmol/L (~125 mg/dL) at admission the mortality rate was the highest 24 . This was the case for eight of our patients. In addition to hyperglycemia, a number of patients (#1, #3, #4, and #5) developed signs of ketoacidosis with arterial blood pH values decreasing to below 7.25 from admission to shortly before death (Table 1) .",

Anti-SARS-CoV-2-N from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc65653) worked in immunofluorescence. In adrenal negative control tissue (non-COVID-19), there was no signal ( Supplementary Fig. 3B ), whereas in lung tissue from COVID-19 patient #2, many infected cells were detected with some background fluorescence ( Supplementary  Fig. 3E ). In the pancreas, the antibody exhibited a background fluorescence signal as well but a clearly positive signal was also displayed in tissues from COVID-19 patients ( Supplementary  Fig. 3F ). Therefore, this antibody (sc65653) was used for all immunofluorescence stainings. An antibody against SARS-CoV-2-S (Genetex, GTX135360) did not function in our tests and was not further used. By staining of SARS-CoV-2-N (using sc65653), viral antigens were detected in the endocrine and exocrine pancreata of all the deceased patients, whereas no viral antigens were detected in the negative controls (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 4 ). This shows that the infection is systemic and not specific to betacells. An analysis of the cellular fluorescence in beta-cells confirmed that in COVID-19 patients the fluorescence level for SARS-CoV-2-N was significantly higher than the background fluorescence observed in control patients. The highest level was observed in patient #7 (Fig. 1b, Table 2 ).",

To further examine if human pancreatic islets are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, we established a protocol for transduction of isolated human islets with lentiviral vector pseudotypes expressing GFP and containing a truncated SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein on their surface (SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus). Three days after infection, we fixed the intact islets and stained for DAPI (Fig. 1e ). In untransduced islets and islets transduced with pseudoviruses containing the empty lentiviral vector just expressing GFP (pUC19), no green cells were detected. As positive control for the methodology, islets were transduced with lentiviral VSV-G pseudotypes (VSV-G pseudovirus). These VSV-G pseudoviruses express the VSV glycoprotein, which binds to the LDL receptor expressed on almost all cell types. Thereby they exhibit a very broad tropism. This is confirmed in our experiment, where around 30% of cells in the islets got infected (Fig. 1e ). On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses has a much lower tropism as they will only infect cells expressing ACE2 and the co-factor TMPRSS2. In islets transduced with SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, 1-3 cells per islet got infected showing that islet cells are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1e ). These results are consistent with our unpublished results using SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus transduction of HEK293 cells overexpressing ACE2, where we see around 15% transduction.",

By using RNA in situ hybridization we detected viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA in islets in six of the eleven COVID-19 patients (#3 and #5-9) (Fig. 1f , Supplementary Fig. 5 and Table 2 ). An archival control (Ctrl #2, pancreatic tissue collected in 2011) was used to ensure specificity of SARS-CoV-2 probes. The SARS-CoV-2-S signal was very low compared to the INS signal, but morphometric analysis showed that the viral RNA was detected in the insulin-producing betacells (Fig. 1g ). In the exocrine tissue, no viral RNA was detected. In other five of the eleven patient tissues (#1-2, #4, #10, and #11), RNA quality was low because of tissue autolysis and neither INS nor SARS-CoV-2-S was detectable. The reason why only small amounts of viral RNA were detected (Fig. 1g ) might be due to the fact that all patients, except for #2 and #11, died more than 3 weeks after the initial infection with SARS-CoV-2. This could mean that no or just few active virus particles were still present.",

Scale bars, 20 \u00b5m. contradictory results have been reported. For example, three different studies showed a higher expression of ACE2 in the exocrine duct cells than in the islets [20] [21] [22] , whereas other studies showed that ACE2 is preferentially expressed in beta-cells 13, 17 . Expression of ACE2 was detected in the microvasculature in both the exocrine and endocrine pancreas 17, 20, 21 . Our own gene expression data on human islets and EndoC1 beta-cells shows a very low expression of ACE2 in beta-cells (unpublished). By single-cell sequencing, we have shown that in pancreata from mice, both ACE2 and an alternative entry receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4 also known as CD26) are highly expressed in delta-cells followed by beta-and alpha-cells (unpublished). To clear these contradictory results, we have examined the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in pancreatic tissue from eleven patients that died of COVID-19 and compared to control tissues. First, we tested and validated different antibodies against these potential receptors and proteases involved in virus entry. We selected three commercially available ACE2 antibodies and two TMPRSS2 antibodies. These antibodies were tested on paraffin and cryosections from human pancreas or adrenal tissue (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). For paraffin sections, we performed antigen retrieval by boiling for 3 min in citrate buffer in an NxGen pressure cooker. Two of the ACE2 antibodies (Thermo Fisher, MA531394 and Abcam, ab15348) showed similar stainings ( Supplementary Fig. 3A , D) and both were used throughout the study. A third ACE2 antibody, which has been widely used, is AF933 from R&D Systems. This antibody did not work under the conditions we tested and was not further used ( Supplementary Fig. 3B) . A TMPRSS2-antibody from Abcam (ab92323) worked nicely ( Supplementary Fig. 3A ). Anti-TMPRSS2 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc515727) showed a similar staining pattern but also in the nucleus ( Supplementary  Fig. 3C ). Therefore, ab92323 was chosen for further immunofluorescence stainings.",

As observed in other studies 17, 20, 21 , in nine COVID-19 patients and one control tissue (Ctrl #3), ACE2 was expressed in the microvasculature (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Table 2 ). This was identified by double staining for the endothelial marker VCAM-1 (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 7) , which is known to be upregulated in endothelial cells after inflammation leading to lymphocyte infiltration 26 . The same pattern we observed in tissue from septic patients and in non-COVID-19 patients with pancreatitis. Conversely, in one control (Ctrl #1) and three patients (COVID-19 #1, #2, and #6), ACE2 was highly expressed in beta-cells ( Fig. 2a and supplementary Fig. 6 ) fitting with the study from Fignani et al., showing expression of ACE2 in beta-cells and that this expression was increased in response to proinflammatory cytokines 17 . In COVID-19 patients #1 and #2, more than 90% of the insulin-producing beta-cells were positive for ACE2. In Ctrl #1 and COVID-19 patient #6, around 10% of the beta-cells expressed ACE2, whereas all other patients expressed ACE2 in less than 3% of the beta-cells (Fig. 2c) . For COVID-19 patient #2, morphometric analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens were found both in the ACE2-positive betacells and in ACE2-negative exocrine cells (Fig. 2d) . Analysis of the cellular fluorescence density further confirmed that in the two ACE2-types of patients, independent of their ACE2 expression, SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens were detected in both endothelial, exocrine and endocrine cells (beta-cells and non beta-cells) (Fig. 2e) . The highest SARS-CoV-2 level was detected in beta-cells of COVID-19 patient # 2 also showing the highest ACE2 level in beta-cells (Fig. 2f) . Conversely, patients with a high ACE2 expression in endothelial cells did not show a significantly higher level of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in these cells (Fig. 2f) . because they already had a high ACE2 expression. It has previously been shown that the expression of ACE2 is sex-and age-specific 27, 28 . However, in our study with 17 donors in total, we do not see any tendencies in this direction.",

As not just ACE2-positive cells were positive for viral particles in the pancreas, we decided to investigate the expression of alternative receptors and factors shown to facilitate virus entry. The MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 has been suggested as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV-2 29 , and has has previously been shown to be expressed by cells of the immune system as well as on epithelia and endothelia cells in pancreas, lungs, and kidney 30 . In the non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients in our study, DPP4 was expressed in both the endocrine and exocrine pancreas ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 9 ). For COVID-19 patient #2, morphometric analysis showed that viral antigens were found in DPP4-positive beta-cells in both the endocrine and exocrine pancreas (Fig. 3b) suggesting that DPP4 could at least partly be responsible for virus entry in the ACE2-negative beta-cells in this patient. Two other proteins, HMBG1 and NRP1 were recently shown to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus entry 31, 32 . In human islets and in control patient tissue, HMBG1 was expressed in most cells but surprisingly, in the islets from the COVID-19 patients only a few cells positive for HMBG1 were detected (Fig. 3d) . This suggests that HMBG1 is downregulated after infection with SARS-CoV-2, also explaining the islet impairment, as HMBG1 has previously been shown to play an important role in inflammation by inhibiting acute pancreatitis 33 . NRP1, shown to facilitate virus entry 31 , was detected in both isolated, control and COVID-19 islets (Fig. 3d) suggesting that in beta-cells with a low ACE2 expression, virus uptake could be facilitated by NRP1, or alternatively DPP4 could work directly as a receptor. Due to their insulin-secreting capacity beta-cells have a high protein turnover, which might explain why these cells are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 despite a low expression of ACE2. Thereby, beta-cells are useful targets for the viruses, which hijack these cells for their own replication. Similar results have been observed with enteroviruses, which have been suggested to cause diabetes 34 . We have also previously shown that a virus-like infection of human islets with polyI:C leads to a decrease in insulin-production in beta-cells 35 .",

While many regulated and nonregulated pathways of necrosis exist, necroptosis is following an evolutionarily conserved pattern, mediated by kinases such as RIPK1 and RIPK3. Importantly, the hallmark feature of necroptosis is a phosphorylation-site in the pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain like (MLKL) protein 38 . pMLKL may then oligomerize and cause the loss of plasma membrane integrity 39 . This process is opposed by the ESCRT-III membrane repair complex, which may be hijacked by viruses 40 . Human coronavirus infection has been suggested to trigger necroptosis 41 and given the necrotic morphology of the islets of the COVID-19 patients, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2-triggered necroptosis might be the cause. To investigate the role of necroptosis in the pancreata, we performed immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining for pMLKL. First, we validated the pMLKLantibody by inducing necroptosis in HT29 cells 42 . This showed that pMLKL was specific for necroptotic cells ( Supplementary  Fig. 3G ). pMLKL-positive cells were detected in all COVID-19 patient samples (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11A) . However, less than 10 islets per patient were highly positive for pMLKL ( Supplementary Fig. 11B ) implicating why just a small percentage of islets were impaired.",

In non-COVID-19 tissue from patients with pancreatitis, pMLKLpositivity was observed, whereas in autopsy tissue from septic patients no pMLKL was detectable ruling out general immunemediated damage (Supplementary Fig. 11A) .

In the exocrine tissue, immune cells were detected in the COVID-19 patients as well, and in the septic control tissue, there was a massive infiltration in the exocrine pancreas (Supplementary Fig. 12A ).
