We test whether: (a) social capital continued to predict lower mental distress during the pandemic; and (b) whether social capital buffered (moderated) the harm of social/ mobility restrictions on psychological distress. In addition, we test the level at which social capital mitigation effects operated, i.e., at the individual-and/or contextual-level. To do so, we apply multilevel models to three waves of the COVID-19 Household Impact Survey consisting of probability samples of U.S. adults (with the average interview completion rate of 93%). In a novel approach, we explore two modes of capturing contextual social capital: aggregated individual-level survey responses and independently measured social capital indices (SCIs). Findings show that at the individual level social capital was associated with lower psychological distress. It also buffered the harm of restrictions: increasing restrictions had a weaker effect on distress among individuals interacting with neighbors more frequently. Importantly, mitigating processes of contextual social capital appeared conditional on how it was measured. Using aggregated survey responses, contextual social capital had no direct effect on distress but exerted an additional buffering role: individuals in counties with higher average neighbor-interaction experienced a weaker impact of restrictions. Using the independent SCI measures, we found county social capital reduced distress. However, its negative effect on distress becomes increasingly weaker the more restrictions an individual reported: where individuals reported lower restrictions, higher county SCI reduced distress; however, where individuals reported higher restrictions, higher county SCI had no effect on distress. More restrictive environments thus cut individuals off from the benefits of higher county social capital as measured using the SCI.",

As people undergo lockdowns and other restrictive measures, their normal routines are disrupted, if not entirely replaced, preventing them from interacting with others (coworkers, friends, family) who constituted their primary social networks during \"ordinary times\". As a result of declining network-ties and group-affiliations, social capital has become more limited and, by virtue of its scarcity, potentially more valuable (Borkowska and Laurence, 2020) . Ironically, as people experience physical-distancing mandates and diminishing social capital, local social ties may have become increasingly important for psychological protection against the stressors of the pandemic (Pitas and Ehmers, 2020) .",

However, not everyone has experienced this impact equally; a critical question is why. We propose that unequal access to social capital may partly account for the unequal distribution of harm to mental wellbeing during the pandemic. The present study is thus motivated by the following question: does social capital, measured at individual and contextual (community) levels, provide a buffer against the harmful effect of social/mobility restrictions intended to curb the coronavirus disease? Using a (pooled cross-sectional) probability sample of U.S. respondents, we provide evidence on how individual/contextual stocks of social capital are related to psychological distress during the coronavirus crisis.",

As a heuristic device, it offers valuable insights into social determinants of health (for reviews, see Ehsan et al., 2019; Ehsan and De Silva, 2015; Villalonga-Olives et al., 2018) . Despite its analytic value, the concept has received criticism (Saegert and Capiano, 2017) . One of the most salient is the lack of consensus on the proper unit of conceptualization and operationalization. That is, it remains unresolved whether social capital should be viewed as a contextual or individual property (Poortinga, 2006; De Clercq et al., 2012; Ferlander, 2007; Lagaert et al., 2021) . This issue has led scholars to conclude that the literature has been dominated by \"the hegemony of the communitarian approach\" (Moore et al., 2005) or that there are \"two meanings of social capital,\" one defined at the individual (micro) level and another at the contextual (macro) level (Portes, 2000) .",

            "text": "Individual and contextual forms of social capital gauge qualitatively distinct aspects of social-life and environment (De Silva et al., 2005; Kawachi et al., 2008) . From a micro, or network, perspective, some studies conceptualize social capital as a \"private good\" by focusing on the health benefits of particularistic social relationships, interactions, and participation measured exclusively at the individual-level (for review, see Smith and Christakis, 2008; Ertel et al., 2009; Gilbert et al., 2013; Perkins et al., 2015) . Taking a more macro-approach, others conceptualize it as a \"public good,\" emphasizing the communal benefits of \"neighborhood\" cohesion, attachment, and belongingness (Carpiano and Hystad, 2011; Elliott et al., 2014; Green et al., 2019; Hikichi et al., 2020; Hoogerbrugge and Burger, 2018; Maass et al., 2016; Nakagomi et al., 2020) . Social capital has also been characterized in terms of its bonding, bridging, and linking functions (Aldrich and Meyer, 2015; Szereter and Woolcock, 2004) . 1 Social capital measured at the contextual level refers to resources available via membership in a broader community, which can generate, for example, \"community resilience\" during times of crisis (Aldrich and Meyer, 2014) . Neighborhood residents can benefit from social cohesion and collective efficacy, i.e., a group's willingness/ability to pursue a common goal, co-operate and help one another (Sampson, 2003 ; for review, see Butel and Braun, 2019) . In comparison, individual social capital refers to concepts such as one's network size, frequency of interpersonal communication, and informal social engagement. Theoretically, the two types or levels of social capital can operate independently of one another. A social hermit may live in a geographic area rich in collective social capital. Conversely, a very well-connected individual could reside in a place where most other residents remain socially fragmented with low group-attachment or sense of belonging. Suffice to say, the debate persists concerning how social capital should be understood and measured in relation to health outcomes (Moore and Carpiano, 2020) .",

            "text": "While the distinctiveness of individual versus contextual social capital is well-recognized, research that incorporates both measures remain limited, making it empirically difficult to analyze their respective importance (Mohnen et al., 2015) . In this study, we treat social capital as properties of both actors and places by capturing individuals' own reported level of social capital (e.g., their frequency of interaction with neighbors) and the contextual-level of social capital in their wider area (e.g., aggregate frequency of neighbor-interaction in their area). We also explore alternative ways of capturing contextual social capital by drawing on two unique sources of data. In constructing \"community social capital,\" researchers largely average individual-responses across higher-level units (e.g., Hoogerbrugge and Burger, 2018; Nieuwenhuis, 2020; Yamaguchi et al., 2019) . This methodological strategy, though widely practiced, has been questioned on grounds of accuracy (Lagaert et al., 2021) . Since high mobility may result in measures that are poor in internal consistency, some studies rely on key informants rather than the residents (Fahmi et al., 2019; Hardyns et al., 2015) . Another, perhaps more critical, issue is endogeneity. When community social capital (e.g., \"neighborhood trust\") is constructed by averaging respondents' reports of trust, models looking at its relationship with health outcomes can be biased to the extent that reverse causation exists between the two units of measurement. Drawing causal inference hence demands examining the effects of pre-existing social capital captured prior to measuring health outcomes, which is largely unmet in research (Frankenburg et al., 2012; Zhanow et al., 2019) .",

Since the outbreak, people (Americans) have been subjected to policies that sharply limit their mobility, leading to isolation. As the basic premise of our study, we first hypothesize that individuals who experience more restrictions in their everyday life will be more psychologically distressed (H1). As previous studies show, social capital can reduce the harmful effects of isolation/loneliness. If so, then where social capital has persisted, it should be of significant value during a pandemic defined, first and foremost, by reduced interpersonal interaction. That is, in view of distancing-measures contracting wider social networks, our next hypothesis states: people who report more individual-level social capital during the pandemic will report lower levels of distress (H2).",

That is, in addition to a direct-effect, access to more social capital ought to exert a buffering-effect, being particularly important for individuals experiencing higher social/mobility restrictions. This leads to our third hypothesis: the impact of restrictions on distress will be weaker among those who report more individual-level social capital, i.e., individual-level social capital will negatively moderate the positive association between restrictions and distress (H3). H2/H3 are based on conceptions of social capital as an individual-level resource. As discussed, social capital is also conceptualized as a property of communities and, even adjusting for an individual's reported social capital, the levels of social capital in the wider context should be beneficial to them. As such, consistent with the existing scholarship, we hypothesize that individuals who live in places with higher aggregate stocks of social capital will report lower levels of distress (H4). Furthermore, based on the idea that individuals may also derive benefits from aggregate stocks of social capital in an area, we expect an interaction-effect involving social/ mobility restrictions and, this time, contextual social capital. More specifically: the impact of restrictions on depression will be weaker among those who live in places with higher aggregate stocks of social capital, i.e., community-level social capital will negatively moderate the positive association between restrictions and distress (H5).",

Based on the first, we follow the conventional method of aggregation in operationalizing community social capital. Then, using the second source, our study provides alternative findings that seek to minimize, though not resolve, problems of simultaneity/endogeneity.

First, at the individual-level, we use three waves (W1-W3) of the COVID-19 Household Impact Survey (\"COVID Impact Survey\"), fielded, respectively, in April (20-26), May (4-10), and June (1-8) of 2020. Data collection was completed by NORC (National Opinion Research Center) at the University of Chicago. The version of Covid Impact Survey analyzed here provides estimates of the US adult household population for 18 regional areas including 10 states (California, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New York, Oregon, Texas) and 8 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (Atlanta, Baltimore, Birmingham, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Phoenix, Pittsburgh). The sampling frame is based on an extract of the U.S. Postal Service delivery-sequence file, covering approximately 97% of the American householdpopulation. A special user agreement with NORC provided access to restricted data with the 4-digit FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard Publication) geocodes at the county level. For the analysis, we pooled the data across W1 (N = 7467; completion rate = 92.7%)), W2 (N = 7420; completion rate = 93.3%), and W3 (N = 6082; completion rate = 92.5%). 8% of respondents had missing values on at least one variable used. After listwise deletion, the effective sample contains 19,198 respondents nested in 800 counties. To test for bias from withincase missingness we undertook several multiple-imputation approaches, 2 which produced substantively unchanged findings. Thus, we report non-imputed results here. Further details on the sampling procedures can be found at the repository (https://www.covid-impact.or g/results).",

Consistent with prior research (for reviews, see e.g., Kawachi and Subramanian, 2006; Moore and Carpiano, 2020) they tap, respectively, a cognitive aspect of social capital (trust in neighbors),\"weak-tie\" aspect of social capital (interaction with neighbors), structural aspect of social capital (volunteering for an organization or association), and \"strong-tie\" aspect of social capital (frequency of communicating with family/friends). In other words, these measures gauge the cognitive/structural and weak/strong dimensions of individual social capital (see Nyqvist et al., 2014) .",

The sub-indices include family-unity (% births to unmarried women; % women currently married; % children with single parent), community-health (non-religious non-profit organizations per 1000; religious congregation per 1000; informal social engagement subindex), and institutional-health (Presidential election voting rate 2012 & 2016; mail-back census response rate; confidence in institutions subindex), and \"collective efficacy\" (violent crimes per 10,000). Scores for the subindices were first standardized to put them on a common scale and then weights were created for each by running principal components analysis. Each county's social capital index score was computed by taking the weighted sum of the scores and then standardizing it (for more detail, see Joint Economic Committee, 2018).

Model 3 (Table 3 ) uses the single index of county social capital (compiled of family unity, community health, institutional health). Here, individuals in counties with higher stocks of social capital report somewhat less mental distress (significant at p < .1). Contrary to the aggregated scores, this shows some evidence for H4: that after adjusting for individual social capital, higher community social capital will reduce distress. Model 4 tests whether SCI-measured county social capital also cushions the impact of restrictions on mental-distress, via an interaction-term between the SCI and reported restrictions. The interaction is weakly significant (p < .1) but also positive, suggesting restrictions have a stronger positive association with psychological distress among individuals in high social capital counties. Fig. 3 (based on Model 4, Table 3 ) plots predicted margins of distress across individuals' reported restrictions for those living at the maximum/minimum county-level SCI. Among individuals in low social capital counties, restrictions have no association with distress, which remains comparatively high across all levels of restrictions. Individuals in high social capital counties who report fewer restrictions (0-8) experience a benefit of high county social capital, reporting lower distress than their peers in low social capital counties. However, the benefit of living in high social capital counties declines as restrictions increase, such that those experiencing moderate-to-high restrictions (>8) essentially report as much mental-distress as individuals in low social capital counties. This provides some evidence that contextual social capital can cushion the harm of restrictions on distress; however, the cushioning-effect gets weaker the greater number of restrictions experienced (H5).",

Firstly, weaker ties, especially neighborconnectivity, appeared most important for psychological-distress. Individuals who interacted more frequently with neighbors reported less distress and experienced a weaker positive impact of social/mobility restrictions on their distress. In addition, individuals living in counties with higher aggregate neighbor-connectivity reported a further cushioning effect from the harm of restrictions. Thus, as hypothesised, localties performed a vital role in compensating for the contraction of wider in-person connectivity, especially where restrictions were higher. In contrast, communicating more frequently by phone/electronically with friends/family had no association with psychological distress, nor did it buffer restrictions. This may be because this stronger-tie connectivity was not in-person, limiting its effectiveness. During non-crisis times, remote strong-tie connectivity may reduce mental-distress. However, in the context of COVID-19, the scarcity of in-person contact in general might mean that remote-interaction, even with strong-ties, does not Table 2 ). suffice, and any type of physical interaction becomes increasingly important. Alternatively, individuals experiencing greater distress could have reached out more to friends/family, confounding any ameliorating impact it may have had on distress. Secondly, these findings shed light on how, and at which level, social capital appears to operate during the pandemic. At the individual-level, (weaker-tie) social capital appears to operate as both a driver of lower distress (a direct-effect) and a buffer of the impact of stressors, namely restrictions (a moderation effect). Processes at the contextual level, however, appear more mixed and our understanding is conditional on how contextual-level social capital is measured. When operationalized using aggregated scores, contextual social capital has no direct effect on distress after adjusting for individual-level social capital. However, (weaker-tie) aggregated social capital does buffer the impact of restrictions on distress, even after adjusting for its individual-level buffering role. In other words, both speaking to neighbors more frequently but also living in counties where neighbors interact more frequently benefits mental well-being.",

One possibility concerns the time periods at which measurements were taken. The SCI is based on surveys/administrative data completed mostly 2013-2016, while the aggregated scores are contemporaneous with the psychological distress scores. Potentially, the pandemic may have undermined contextual-level social capital, and thus our independent measures no longer capture up-to-date social capital. As such, it may be that where individuals report lower restrictions, the SCI indicator remains accurate (having been less affected by the pandemic). Thus, in counties where SCI-measured contextual social capital is higher and individuals' experiences of restrictions lower, residents continue to accrue mental health benefits. However, where individuals report higher restrictions, contextual social capital may have been undermined, and thus, despite living in counties with high pre-pandemic social capital, its negative effect on distress is no longer present given levels may since have been eroded. In contrast, the aggregate scores measured during the pandemic may more accurately reflect current county social capital, demonstrating that where contextual social capital has persisted it serves to cushion the harm of restrictions.",

At the aggregate level, therefore, higher county-level neighbor interaction may simply be driven by lower aggregate distress. Thus, the reason mobility restrictions appear to exert a weaker effect on individuals' mental distress where aggregate neighbor interaction is higher may simply be that individuals in such counties tend to have lower psychological distress (for some unmeasured reason). If so, our findings using aggregated measures are unreliable. Accordingly, our results using the independent county measures would suggest that contextual social capital can operate to reduce distress, but that the pandemic may have cut people off from accessing the social capital benefits in their counties. A third possibility is that the aggregated-/independent-measures are picking up qualitatively different forms of social capital. In particular, Table 3 ).",

Similarly, as alluded to above, any association between social capital and well-being could feasibly be a product of lower distress causing more social capital, generating additional bias. To our knowledge, no longitudinal data currently exists that would allow us to test these individual/contextual social capital processes over time. Lastly, the number of tests performed increases risks of false positives in our findings. Applying the Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) correction, our key findings remain robust at a false discovery rate (FDR) of \u226510 percent; at an FDR of <5 percent, the moderating-effects of our contextual social capital measures would be considered just outside of significance, while individual-levels findings remain significant.
