Thus, they found 163 that iota-form effectively inhibited the virus at 10 \u03bcg/ml while kappa-and lambda-form 164 were only active at 100 \u03bcg/ml 75 . To get more deep-insight, SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a 61-165year-old patient and was amplified in Vero B4 cells and its inhibitory activities were 166 conducted using iota-carrageenan. The IC50 ranged from 0.046 to 1.54 g/ml 75 . The activity 167 of iota-form against SARS-CoV-2 was also studied using Vero E6 and showed less inhibition 168 compared with Vero B4 76, 77 .

Moreover, it was effective at treating 251 common colds caused by both rhinoviruses and coronaviruses 85, 87 . Thus, the 252 transferability of these in vitro data into clinical effectiveness for COVID-19 could be 253 performed and evaluated.254 255 Iota-carrageenan could be administered directly to patients infected with COVID-19 via 256 nasal spray in conjunction with an oral antiviral such as ivermectin. Ivermectin was found 257 to have significant antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in three clinical trials: 258 NCT04343092 (Effectiveness of ivermectin as adjunct therapy in COVID-19 management) 259 90 , NCT04422561 (Prophylactic ivermectin in COVID-19 contacts) 91, 92 , and NCT04381884 260 (Ivermectin effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication in patients with COVID-19)92 . --------------------------------------------Table 2. ------------------------------------------------------------264Table 2.

No adverse events were observed in the treated COVID-19 patients 270 over a 30-day period 93 . In 2021, a randomized controlled 1-1 clinical trial under 271 registration NCT04701710 was conducted to prioritize health personnel infected with 272 SARS-CoV-2 (n = 232) at Argentina's Public Healthcare Centre, using the same iota-273 carrageenan and ivermectin regimen as in the previous study 94 . The result indicated that 274 the number of subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 was significantly lower in the treated 275 group, at 3.4%, than in the control group, at 21.4% (p=0.0001) 94 . The treated group also 276 had a lower prevalence of mild to moderate COVID-19 presentation compared to the 277 control group 94 . This intensive preventive treatment with iota-carrageenan and ivermectin 278 was able to significantly reduce the number of infected health care workers 94 . The study 279 using iota-carrageenan in a single dose is still ongoing under the register numbers 280 NCT04793984, NCT04681001, and NCT04590365. Therefore, the results of these ongoing 281 clinical trials are required to provide conclusive evidence of iota-carrageenan's efficacy in 282 patients with COVID-19. Additionally, there is a dearth of data on carrageenan, particularly 283 regarding drug-drug, drug-gene, and drug-disease interactions. This information is critical 284 in predicting potential adverse events that may occur during treatment. subtypes, including kappa-, iota-, and lambda-, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 289 infection in vitro by interfering with virus adsorption and internalization. The antiviral 290 activity of iota-carrageenan as a single dose administered nasally is being studied in several 291 clinical trials, whereas its co-administration with ivermectin was studied in two clinical 292 trials and demonstrated improvement in outcome for COVID-19 patients. However, large-293 scale clinical trials should be conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of iota-carrageenan 294 and its kappa-and lambda-subtypes in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.",
