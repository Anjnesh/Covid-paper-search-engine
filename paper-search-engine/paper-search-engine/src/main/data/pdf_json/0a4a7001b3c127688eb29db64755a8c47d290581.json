The devices that were used were mostly activity trackers, pedometers and heart rate monitoring. It is documented that real-time performance evaluation and personalized feedback was found to be rather lacking. Future trends in home coaching systems target to close the loop with real-time automated performance evaluations, monitoring, feedback, and more advanced interventions.",
