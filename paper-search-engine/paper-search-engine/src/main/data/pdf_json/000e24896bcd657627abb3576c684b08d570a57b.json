Therefore, this study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature on this subject to determine the clinical efficacy of AZA as maintenance therapy for AIP patients. A systematic search was performed to identify studies on the clinical efficacy of AZA as maintenance therapy in AIP patients. The crude multiple relapse rate was estimated to assess the ability of AZA to control relapses in AIP. Pooled estimates were obtained using a random-effects model with the DerSimonian-Laird method. We identified AIP patients who did not respond to initial steroid treatment, experienced steroid weaning failure, or those who relapsed during remission as refractory cases. After reviewing the studies, ten articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were selected for meta-analysis. Of all 4504 patients, 3534 patients were treated with steroids, and 346 patients were treated with AZA for relapsed AIP. In this meta-analysis, 14/73 (19.2%) patients receiving AZA for refractory AIP relapsed. Meanwhile, 14/47 (29.8%) patients without AZA experienced relapse. The integrated odds ratio for relapse risk in patients receiving AZA was estimated to be 0.52 (p = 0.15). This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated the efficacy of AZA in preventing relapse of AIP, which supports the use of AZA as a maintenance treatment in patients with AIP who relapse upon withdrawal of steroid therapy.",

AIP has distinct clinical, serological, radiological, and histological features from other types of AP or CP, such as hereditary, alcoholic, and preduodenal pancreatitis. The pathogenesis of AIP is considered to involve autoimmunity based on the rapid resolution of signs and symptoms related to pancreatic inflammation after the initiation of corticosteroid (CS) treatment.

Unfortunately, 15-60% of patients experience disease relapse during the initial tapering of steroids and after steroid treatment, despite the high initial response rate. Regarding a clinical study on the prevention of AIP relapse, Kamisawa et al. examined the efficacy of low-dose daily prednisone (PSL) (2.5-10 mg) in AIP patients and reported that the relapse rates in the steroid continued group and the discontinued group were 23% and 34%, respectively (p = 0.048) [3] . Additionally, Masamune et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial to clarify the efficacy of maintenance CS therapy in patients with AIP [4] . This study demonstrated that maintenance therapy with CS at 5-7.5 mg/day for three years might decrease relapses in AIP patients compared to those who discontinued the treatment at 26 weeks. Based on these findings, the continuation of low-dose CS may be useful for maintaining AIP remission.",

            "text": "A large Japanese cohort study [5] of AIP patients reported that 1223 (84.4%) of 1449 patients with AIP received initial CS treatment, and maintenance steroid therapy in AIP was used in 85.0% of patients, with a mean duration (SD) of 38.8 months (31.5 months). On the other hand, immunomodulators (IMs) [azathioprine (AZA) or 6-MP] were administered to 59 of 1234 patients (4.8%). These data indicate that IMs are rarely used for steroid tapering in AIP patients, and long-term CS administration is favored. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the AIP relapse rate was 14% after 3 years, 25% after 5 years, 40% after 10 years, and 50% after 15 years. Concerning the daily dose (mg) of PSL at the time of relapse, approximately half of patients relapsed under the CS-free condition, and 32.6% of patients relapsed despite being on more than 5 mg/day of PSL. Based on these results, it is essential to establish some type of remission maintenance therapy for early withdrawal of CS and prevention of relapse in AIP patients who are generally more commonly elderly. With respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been suggested that elderly patients and long-term steroid use are associated with COVID-19 severity. Additionally, given the complications associated with the long-term use of CS, it is essential to maintain AIP patients' steroid-free remission. The efficacy of AZA in preventing relapse and maintaining remission of AIP has been reported. However, most of these publications are case series, and there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Therefore, this study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature on this subject to determine the clinical efficacy of AZA as maintenance therapy in AIP patients.",

According to these recommendations, selection bias (prospective selection or not) is essential information to maintain the quality of study. A retrospective cohort study has a higher risk of researcher bias (e.g., confirmatory bias, question-order bias, and leading questions or wording bias). In this regard, we evaluated the representative cohort in accordance with the criteria mentioned in the most recent meta-analysis regarding AIP treatment [11] . Regarding the initial dose of steroid, according to an international consensus on the treatment of AIP, the 0.6 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg of PSL treatments may be the same scorers. On the other hand, in the majority of all the studies included in this meta-analysis, AIP patients had received PSL treatment with an initial dose of 30-40 mg/day, but not 1 mg/kg of PSL. In this meta-analysis with the limited number of observational cohort studies, we considered it necessary to reduce the bias associated with the heterogeneity of treatment as much as possible. In this regard, we defined a dosage of 30-40 mg/day or 0.6 mg/kg of steroid as point 2, and 1 mg/kg as point 1. ",

Figure 1 ). The crude multiple relapse rate was estimated to assess the efficacy of AZA for controlling relapses in AIP. Pooled estimates were obtained using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Pearson chi-square test and the I 2 statistic. For all other analyses, a p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Regarding remission induction for AIP, steroid treatment is the mainstay because several clinical studies have already reported high steroid responsiveness in AIP patients. A national multicenter survey in Japan [5] demonstrated a remission rate of 98% in AIP patients treated with 0.6 mg/kg of CS. An international multicenter study [32] reported that remission rates in AIP patients with type I and type II who received CS were 99.6% and 92.3%, respectively. Based on these cohort data, we initiated CS for patients with an initial diagnosis of AIP. The clinical challenge is that AIP patients typically relapse after steroid withdrawal or fail steroid weaning, despite the higher response rate to steroid treatment in AIP. In data pooled from three treatment studies in patients with AIP or IgG4-associated cholangitis (IAC), the overall relapse rate in AIP patients who received CS ranged from 27 to 53%. Japanese cohort data [5] demonstrated that the AIP patient relapse rate has been increasing each year according to Kaplan-Meier analysis. More than 30% of patients relapse, even when taking more than 5 mg of CS daily.",

They concluded that treatment with initial high-dose CS might reduce the risk of relapsed AIP. However, the risk of side effects related to CS increased as the cumulative total CS dose increased. This meta-analysis demonstrated the efficacy of AZA in addition to CS for preventing relapse and maintaining remission in AIP patients for whom the initial dose of CS was relatively low (i.e., 30 mg/day or 0.6 mg/ kg/body). In this regard, AZA can contribute to reducing the total dose of CS in relapsed AIP patients.",

In this meta-analysis, we focused on the therapeutic preventive effect of AZA on AIP relapse because AZA is the most commonly used IM for AIP. Its utility has also been evaluated in other immune disorders. Maire et al. reported that four patients treated with AZA who were unresponsive to CS or who experienced CS weaning failure exhibited no relapse or adverse effects [14, Supplementary Fig. 3 ]. On the other hand, Xin et al. reported that eight of 34 patients who received reinitiation of steroids without AZA experienced repeated relapses [18, Supplementary Fig. 7 ].

            "text": "However, in determining the efficacy of AZA treatment, we should consider the dose and how long AZA is appropriate for maintenance therapy of AIP. In fact, in this meta-analysis, we found that the dose of AZA varied for each study, such as 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, and 2-2.5 mg/ kg/day. All data used in the meta-analysis came from Western patients. Therefore, it is not appropriate to apply these doses to Asian patients with AIP. Based on the racial difference in nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X-type motif 15 (NUDT15) and thiopurine methyltransferase activity between Caucasians and Asian patients, monitoring their 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6TGN) levels is required to determine the optimal AZA dose for controlling AIP, which is also relevant in other autoimmune diseases. Unfortunately, none of the studies enrolled in the metaanalysis checked the 6-TGN levels to adjust the optimal AZA dose. Although this meta-analysis suggests the benefit of AZA in preventing AIP relapse compared to Another issue is side effects related to AZA is that it causes significant side effects, such as pancreatitis, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and vomiting), liver injury, severe leukopenia, and hair loss. Among them, most physicians are concerned about pancreatitis. The risk of acute pancreatitis following AZA treatment is relatively low, despite the unknown frequency of AZA-induced pancreatitis in AIP patients. In clinical practice, given that an AIP patient develops pancreatitis during AZA treatment, it is difficult to determine whether AIP relapses or AZA has side effects. AZA-induced pancreatitis is an unpredictable and dose-independent adverse event affecting 2-7% of IBD patients treated with AZA [39] . There is a recent report indicating that the HLA-DQA1-HLA-DRB1 polymorphism is an important marker for AZA-induced pancreatitis risk [39] . Therefore, to avoid AZA-induced pancreatitis in Caucasians, an examination of HLA typing would be helpful. In 10 included studies for this metaanalysis, AZA-related side effects were observed in 21 (14.6%) of 144 patients. The side effects in AZA-treated patients were intolerance (n = 13), nausea (n = 4), dizziness (n = 1), hepatitis (n = 1), anaphylactic shock (n = 1), and myelosuppression (n = 1). However, there were no reports regarding severe leukopenia or hair loss related to AZA, which are observed in Asian patients. A strong association between NUDT15 gene polymorphism and thiopurines related to acute severe leukopenia or hair loss has been reported in people of Asian ancestry [40] [41] [42] . Patients who are homozygous and heterozygous for p. Arg139Cys (NUDT15 T/T and C/T genotype, respectively) have lower enzyme activity than those homozygous for the wild allele (C/C genotype), resulting in dose-dependent AEs [43] . We also know that the frequency of the high-risk genotype in Japanese people is approximately 1%. Therefore, initial screening for NUDT15 gene polymorphisms is useful for eliminating on-site physicians' concerns about prescribing thiopurines. Therefore, genotyping for NUDT15 is essential in AIP patients of Asian descent for whom we consider AZA administration.",

First, differences in patient background, study design, sample size, the severity of AIP, and treatment protocol, including the initial dose of CS for remission induction, might affect the quantitative analysis.

Second, a relatively small number of studies included in this meta-analysis might have sampling bias. However, the funnel plot for relapse rate showed an approximately symmetrical appearance, suggesting that this meta-analysis was absent of any bias. Third, all studies included in this meta-analysis were observational studies. Differences in background factors between groups administered AZA and groups not administered AZA were not clearly described in each study; therefore, meta-regression analysis to examine the impact of moderator variables on study effect size could not be performed. Generally, it is appropriate to use survival analysis because relapse is an event observed during treatment; however, Cox regression analysis regarding treatment with azathioprine and relapse was not performed in referred papers for this meta-analysis. Instead, we applied the odds ratio, rather than the hazard ratio, as the effect measure in the meta-analysis. From this point of view, we cannot deny that the present analysis contains exploratory elements. In general practice, AZA was administered to steroid-dependent, steroid-refractory patients and those with AIP with multiple relapses [14, 19, 20] . Thus, the group with AZA included more patients with refractory AIP than that without AZA. Therefore, in this study, where adjustment for background factors was difficult, the outcome of interventional treatment with AZA could have been considered unfavorable. Nevertheless, it is be noted that this meta-analysis demonstrated that the integrated odds ratio for relapse risk in patients with AZA was estimated to be 0.52.",
