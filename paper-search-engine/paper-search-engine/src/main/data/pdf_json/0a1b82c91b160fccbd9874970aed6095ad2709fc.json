            "text": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) based vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) are highly effective at providing immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there is uncertainty about the duration of immunity, evolution of IgG antibody levels and IgG avidity (an index of antibody-antigen binding strength), and differences in the immune responses between vaccines. Here we performed a prospective pilot study of 71 previously COVID-19 free subjects upon receiving both doses of either the Pfizer (n = 54) or Moderna (n = 17) mRNA vaccine. Anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies were measured longitudinally using a qualitative finger stick MidaSpot\u2122 rapid test at the point-ofcare for initial screening and a quantitative dry blood spot-based pGOLD\u2122 laboratory test over ~ four months post-vaccination. The average anti-RBD IgG antibody levels peaked at ~ two weeks after the second dose of the vaccine and declined thereafter, while antibody avidity increased, suggesting antibody maturation. Moderna vaccine recipients compared to Pfizer vaccine recipients exhibited higher side effect severity, higher peak anti-RBD IgG antibody levels, and higher avidity up to the 90 days period. Differences in antibody levels diminished at ~ 120 days post-vaccination, in line with the similar efficacy observed in the two vaccines. The MidaSpot\u2122 rapid test detected 100% anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD positivity for fully vaccinated subjects in both Pfizer and Moderna cohorts post full vaccination but turned negative greater than 90 days post-vaccination for 5.4% of subjects in the Pfizer cohort, whose quantitative anti-IgG were near the minimum levels of the group. Immune responses were found to vary greatly among vaccinees. Personalized longitudinal monitoring of antibodies could be necessary to assess the immunity duration of vaccinated individuals.",

Moreover, until herd immunity is successfully induced in a large population throughout the world, SARS-CoV-2 infections are likely to become endemic, leading to further loss of life. In response, multiple vaccine candidates based on RNA and DNA technologies, inactivated viruses, and other approaches have been rapidly developed 1-3 . Especially in the United States, two messenger RNA 19, 20 . Neutralization assays [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] have been developed to quantify antibodies directly responsible for neutralizing viruses, and a strong correlation between neutralizing antibody titers with antibody levels against spike protein/RBD in COVID-19 patients has been reported 20,26-34 . In addition, antibody avidity measures the strength of antibody binding to viral antigens, shedding light on antibody maturation, and is potentially useful for assessing vaccine efficacy [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Therefore, it is important to measure both IgG levels and avidity to assess not only antibody quantity but also viral antigen binding ability post-infection or post-vaccination over time. On the other hand, reliable and inexpensive tests could be implemented in hospitals, clinics, various point-of-care (POC) sites, and even at home for frontline qualitative antibody detection to assess immune responses to COVID-19 infection or vaccination.",

Importantly, there has been accumulating evidence that anti-spike/RBD IgG levels are strongly correlated with neutralizing activity in COVID-19 patients 26-30 and vaccinated individuals 44 .

The 4-months post-vaccination results are presented here as an interim report, and the study will continue up to more than a year. Thus far, both vaccines elicit similar levels of anti-RBD IgG and avidity at the 4-month timepoint, suggesting that both vaccines are similarly efficient at protecting vaccinated populations. We compared the two mRNA vaccinee groups and observed interesting differences, and the results might shed light on vaccine development. An ideal vaccine would be one that generates not only high antibody levels, but also high viral-antigen binding strength, and at the same time affords well-tolerated side effect severity. With the vaccinees, we observed that in general, although antibody levels decreased over time, antibody maturation was observed with increased antigen binding strength, boding well for sustained immunity. We did observe highly variable immune responses including those with well below average anti-RBD IgG levels and avidity. It is therefore important to monitor immune responses at the individualized and personalized level, identify those who are still at risk even after vaccination, and provide meaningful measures to protect them from infections.",

A mixture of diluted anti-RBD IgG/IgM purified antibodies as signal normalizer was loaded into the neighboring well on the same row as each sample tested, and a blank control (10% FBST only) was included on each biochip; 3) Secondary antibody incubation: each well was subsequently incubated with a mixture of 4 nM iFluor TM 820-labeled anti-human IgG secondary antibody, 4 nM CF647-labeled antihuman IgM secondary antibody, and 4 nM iFluor TM 820-labeled streptavidin in a 2% BSA solution for 30 minutes at room temperature. Each well was washed six times with 1X PBST (10X PBST: 10X PBS with 0.5% Tween 20) between steps. The iFluor TM 820-labeled streptavidin in the detection step binds to BSA-biotin spots in each well on the pGOLD\u2122 biochip, and the signal was used as an \"intrawell signal normalizer\". In parallel, row-dependent, antigen-specific \"adjacent well\" normalization was performed to normalize antigen printing variation or slide-to-slide variation. Anti-RBD IgG/IgM levels were calculated as the ratio of anti-RBD signal of the sample to that of the adjacent well normalizer and multiplied by 100.",

Early data analysis from the phase III Pfizer and Moderna vaccine clinical trials demonstrated that the vaccines were more than 90% effective in preventing illness and reducing disease severity and hospitalizations 7,8 . Further research has provided clear proof that both mRNA vaccines also elicited sufficient neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants such as B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, D614G, and their combinations 9,10 . Recent reports in Israel, Qatar, and the United States have further confirmed the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 or its variants under realworld conditions 11-14 . Currently, tens of millions of doses are being administered daily worldwide under the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), with early longitudinal data suggesting that both mRNA vaccines are effective for at least six months and that a booster shot may be required 15 . There are many unknowns regarding the long-term efficacy of these newer vaccine technologies and the level and duration of protective immunogenicity. Furthermore, few studies have compared the currently available vaccines to assess potential differences in elicited antibody responses and side effects. The production of antibodies in response to COVID-19 infection or vaccination in hosts is important to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Various diagnostic and point-of-care (POC) platforms utilizing enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 16 , chemiluminescent immunoassays (CIA) 17 , and plasmonic gold near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence amplification 18 have been developed to measure early IgA and IgM, and late IgG responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD)",

Immune responses of Pfizer versus Moderna vaccinated cohorts We then analyzed the immune responses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccinated cohorts separately. We observed that the Moderna vaccinees showed higher average anti-RBD IgG levels in the first three months than the Pfizer vaccinees (Figure 4a), accompanied by more intense side effects right after the first and second dosing (Table 1, Figure 4c). The differences in the average anti-RBD IgG levels measured with the two cohorts decreased over time and were on par measured at the ~ four-month timepoint (Figure 4a). The average anti-RBD IgG avidity index measured for the Moderna cohort showed a jump after the second dose (a similar trend as the antibody level) to a level much higher than the Pfizer cohort in the same time course (Figure 4b). While the Moderna cohort's mean anti-IgG avidity index remained relatively stable (Figure 4b) over four months, the Pfizer cohort of vaccinees showed a clear increasing trend in avidity, reaching a similar average as the Moderna cohort but still with a lower minimum avidity (Figure 4b).",

Both the Pfizer BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines were designed to express the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a prefusion state to induce a sustained humoral immune response in vaccinated individuals 3,42,43 . The mRNA vaccines have shown high efficacy in the real world and are largely responsible for bringing COVID-19 under control in the US 13,14 and other regions 11,12 . It is currently unknown how long immunity will last, and booster vaccine shots in about one year from the initial dose have been suggested/forecasted. Immunity to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases are dependent on the generation of systemic neutralizing antibodies in the host elicited by past infection or vaccination. Strictly speaking, neutralizing antibody levels in vaccinees should be closely monitored longitudinally for a large cohort of vaccinees to assess the duration of immunity to COVID-19.
