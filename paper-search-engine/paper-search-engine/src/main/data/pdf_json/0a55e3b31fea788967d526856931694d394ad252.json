In addition, the moderating effect of sleep problems was examined. A total of 11014 school teachers completed the online survey. The participants were divided into two (high and low sleep problem) groups, according to the severity of their sleep problems, for comparison. The research conducted a comparison between the degree of PIU and psychological distress, and then provided correction for the 2 two groups separately. The results indicated that the high sleep problem group exhibited significantly greater psychological distress [mean (SD)= 12.94 (11.29)] than the low sleep problem group [(mean (SD)= 3.42 (6.57)]. Both PSU and PSMU were positively correlated with psychological distress in the two groups. The moderating effect of sleep problems was supported and PSMU was more harmful to psychological distress in the high sleep problem group, while the effect of PSU on psychological distress was not significantly different between the two groups.",

Any APPs on a smart phone device can integrate the exchange of instant messages, pictures, videos, games, and voice calls via the Internet [12, 13] . Today, social media apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and Tik-Tok play an important role as a platform for social behavior [14, 15] . In addition, because of the high loyalty of social platforms, various online activities such as games, chat, and creation may also appear on social platforms [16] . During the COVID-19 quarantine period, young people often used social networks to relax, and shopping behaviors also occurred instantaneously, when recommended ads popped up on their social platforms [15] . The use of social media on smartphones today means more complex multitasking behaviors, the results of which require constant attention. In the new information age, this study investigated two types of behaviors: problematic smartphone use (PSU) and problematic social media use (PSMU) within the framework of problematic Internet use (PIU). 4 During this pandemic, children and adolescents have spent significantly more time surfing the Internet at home as students take classes remotely [17] , resulting in more screen time usage. This habitual situation has increased as people also need to use their smartphones to contact relatives and friends, update epidemic information, and obtain contact tracking information [18] . However, excessive internet usage and extended screen time can adversely affect cognition and development, especially in children, adolescents, and young people [19] . Studies have indicated that if students have a high rate of social media usage, they may use social media as an unhealthy strategy for dealing with negative emotions and daily problems [20] .",

For example, Coyne et al. conducted an 8-year longitudinal study, and the results indicated that an increase in time spent on social media was not related to an increase in mental health problems [30] . The possible reason for the inconsistent results may be due to confounding variables (e.g., gender, interpersonal relationships, and health status). Among these variables, sleep problems are critical factors that have been identified to be associated with PIU [31] and psychological distress [32] . Rationally, the association between PIU and psychological distress is intensified in people with severe sleep problems. 5 Similarly, this association may also be less notable in people without severe sleep problems. However, this moderating effect should be tested.",

Furthermore, a possible moderator for sleep problems has not yet been clarified in the context of school suspension. Before the pandemic, school teachers were prone to mental illness [34] . Considering the nature of teachers' work tasks during the outbreak (e.g., school teachers should devote more time to work), we should examine teachers' mental illness during this difficult time. As such, this study aims to examine the association between PIU, psychological distress, and sleep problems among school teachers. Moreover, the possible moderating effect of sleep problems was examined.",

Among these items, two were from the Chinese Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) [42] and one was from the Chinese version of FCV-19S [43, 44] . The two items from PCL-5 were: -In the past few months, the severity of the following conditions has bothered you\u2016: (i) repeated dreams of disturbing stressful events (0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, 2 = moderate, 3 = very serious, and 4 = extremely); (ii) difficulty falling asleep or sleeping well (0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, 2 = moderate, 3 = very serious, and 4 = extremely). The item from FCV-19S was: -I couldn't sleep well because I was worried about being infected by COVID-19\u2016 (1 = totally disagree to 5 = completely agree). The contents of these three items all sought to ask the participants about the severity of sleep disturbances; therefore, we summed the score of each item to represent the severity of the sleep problem with higher scores indicating high sleep problems.

Second, an independent t-test was used to compare the differences between the high and low sleep problem groups regarding psychological distress, PSU, and PSMU. Third, the Pearson correlation was used to analyze the correlation among the observed variables (i.e., psychological distress, PSU, and PSMU) by high and low sleep problem groups. Finally, a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was used to evaluate the overall model fit for the high and low sleep groups. Consequently, a 8 multiple-group analysis with SEM was adopted to test the moderating effect of sleep problems on the influence of PSU and PSMU on psychological distress. In the model, PSU and PSMU served as exogenous latent variables, and psychological distress was an endogenous latent variable using the scores of three subscales (i.e., subscales of depression, anxiety, and stress) as respective indicators. Some critical demographic variables were included in the model as control variables: school type, gender, years of work experience, whether they served as a home-teacher, or had online teaching experience before school suspension. A combination of model fit indices was used to evaluate the overall model fit: comparative fit index (CFI), non-normed fit index (NNFI) > 0.90, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < 0.10, and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) < 0.08 [46] . Furthermore, the moderating effect was examined by a chi-square difference test. Specifically, we constrained the coefficient from PSU and PSMU on psychological distress effect as equal across high and low sleep problem groups. When the difference of the value of chi-square from the unconstrained model to constrained model meets the significant level, the moderating effect is considered present. Table 1 presents the results of the frequency (percentage) and the chi-squared test for the demographic variables. The results indicate that there are significant differences between the high and low sleep problem groups regarding school type, gender, and years of work experience. Specifically, the proportion of middle school teachers in the high sleep problem group is significantly higher than that of primary school teachers (\u03c7 2 = 9.82, p < 0.001), and the proportion of male teachers in the high sleep problem group is significantly higher than that of female teachers (\u03c7 2 = 31.53, p < 0.001); those with more than 11 years of work experience have a significantly higher proportion in the high sleep problem group, while those with less than 5 years of work experience have a significantly higher proportion in the low sleep problem group (\u03c7 2 = 66.20, p < 0.001). We also identified that the two demographic variables (whether they served as a home-teacher or had online teaching experience before school suspension) had no significant relationship with teachers' sleep problems.

First, there were varying degrees of differences in sleep problems regarding teachers' school type, gender, and years of work experience. We identified that during the pandemic, male, older teachers (teachers with more teaching experience), and middle school teachers have been under unknown pressures, which may be affecting their sleep quality. Additionally, we also identified that teachers' sleep problems did not differ depending on whether they served as a home-teacher or had prior online teaching experience.
