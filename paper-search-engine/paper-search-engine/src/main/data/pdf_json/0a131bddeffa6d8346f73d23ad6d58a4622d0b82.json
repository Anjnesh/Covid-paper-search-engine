[1] [2] [3] Given the low incidence of serious disease in children, policy makers and service providers felt that improvements could be made regarding parents' knowledge of childhood illness, when to seek help and how to care for their children with minor illness. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] During the first lockdown between March and May 2020 in the United Kingdom, when all nonessential shops and services including schools were closed, the numbers of children presenting to primary and emergency care fell significantly 9-13 by up to 50% for all presenting conditions. While serious illness, such as sepsis, is relatively rare, this dramatic fall led to concern that children were not being brought to medical services and were potentially becoming more ill at home. These findings were supported by surveys of United Kingdom, Irish 12 and Dutch 14 paediatricians who were asked to report children presenting late to hospital. Before and during the pandemic, a small proportion of children were reported to present late in the course of an illness, as indicated by RAG (red, amber, green) symptoms of illness severity (based on the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health's [RCPCH] safety net tool 15 ). RAG systems ascribe a relative risk to a collection of physiological and behavioural characteristics and assign a green (safe for discharge), amber (needs evaluation) and However, it remains unclear whether late presentations increased during the pandemic. 16 Anxiety about using health services because of fear of infection, amongst the public, was reported during earlier epidemics: SARS (2003) in Canada 17 and Taiwan, 18 Ebola in West Africa (2014) (2015) (2016) 19 and H1N1 (2009) in Hong Kong 20 and in Turkey. 21 In the United Kingdom, it was assumed that it was the worry about becoming ill with COVID-19 that was causing parents to keep their children at home when they were ill or injured. 22 Messages from the UK government initially asked the public to avoid using health services unless it was really necessary. These messages included 'only call 111 [the National Health Service (NHS) telephone helpline NHS111] if you're unable to get help online'. Although this advice no longer appears on government websites, it continues to be repeated across UK regional health service webpages. [23] [24] [25] This reduction in access to services may also have created positive outcomes for parent's self-care of their children, as they may have developed ways of coping with, and managing, their child's illness or injury independently.",

This approach enabled data collection while parents' experience of managing a child with an illness or injury during lockdown was fresh in their minds. An online SNAP survey (www.snapsurveys. com) was chosen to enable anonymized data collection without the need for face-to-face contact, thus avoiding any additional risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection. See Supporting Information Appendix S1 for the survey questions. Surveys have the advantage of facilitating the collection of data from a wide range of participants who are geographically disparate. The survey consisted of multiplechoice questions with 'other' options to add free text to explain alternative responses. Questions within the survey were designed using evidence from research exploring parents' usual care for sick or injured children at home and their decision-making about seeking medical help for their children. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] Questions about the symptoms that their child had experienced were structured using the poster developed by the RCPCH to help parents know when to seek help for a sick or injured child. 15 The phrase 'Stay Home period' was used in the survey to refer to lockdown as this was the term used by the UK government at the time. The resulting questionnaire was reviewed twice by a small group of parents (drawn from a parent panel and parent members of existing research teams) to establish face validity.",

One parent reported that the GP they consulted appeared to be scared to conduct a physical examination.

The next most common symptoms reported were behavioural changes and injury, with symptoms of acute illness reported much less often, possibly also reflecting the reduction in all infections. Analysis of the professional severity scoring (RAG rating) of the symptoms reported highlighted a small group of parents who did not seek help for red or amber symptoms. Few parents reported using information already present in the home to help them manage their child's illness/injury. Most looked online for information, which can be scary, inconsistent or confusing.8 Together, these results indicate that safety netting information, to help parents determine the severity of their child's illness and whether or not they need to seek medical help, is still not easily available in a reliable form for parents, repeating earlier findings.8,39 Lim et al.40 trialled a leaflet on the recognition of serious illness in children during the lockdown in the North East of England and found that parents felt it increased their confidence, although few had used the leaflet for a sick child. Mobile apps available in this area were not referred to by parents completing our survey.6.1 | Strengths and limitationsThis was the first detailed survey that aimed to establish how the first UK lockdown during the pandemic influenced parents help-seeking for, and care of, ill or injured children. We involved parents at every stage from design of the questionnaire to editing this paper. Patient and public involvement is considered to result in better-quality research,41,42 although    there is no evidence concerning the most effective methods for doing so in child health research.41 Multiple-choice questions provided a picture of responses for the whole sample, which were then augmented by the detailed free text responses. The results included data from all four countries of the United Kingdom. However, far more people completed the question from the South West, illustrating the power of personal networks in engaging people in research, as the project leads were based in the South West. The sample included families living in both urban and rural settings and children across the childhood age range.However, the biggest group of returns was from parents of children aged 5-12 years. This does not reflect the age group with the highest incidence of childhood illness/injury or use of health services prepandemic,3,43 but may represent the group whose parents were able to find time to complete the questionnaire. Alternatively, the reduction in infections may have been greater in this younger group of children. Public health services for the younger age group (0-2 years) were reduced/ suspended 44 ; consequently, this group of parents may have changed their help-seeking during the lockdown as they were unable to access health visitors (UK public health nurses). No data were gathered to indicate how help-seeking for this group of parents changed.",
