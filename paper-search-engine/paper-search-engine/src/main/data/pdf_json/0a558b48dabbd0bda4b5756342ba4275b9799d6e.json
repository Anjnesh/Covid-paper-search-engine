This paper investigates the impact of perceived privacy on cognitive irritation and sleep problems among employees who worked from home during the pandemic. Additionally, we analyzed the role of cognitive irritation as a mediator between privacy and sleep problems. We created a cross-sectional questionnaire, which was completed by 293 employees who performed home-based telework in German-speaking Switzerland. A mediation analysis was then conducted using a multiple regression analysis. A test of the indirect effect showed a significant mediation path from perceived privacy via cognitive irritation to sleep problems. Hence, the negative indirect effect indicates that perceived privacy is an important job resource that may prevent sleep problems. Further research is needed regarding home-based telework and recovery strategies to prevent sleep problems.",

Moreover, evidence (e.g., diary studies 30) and meta-analysis 31) ) has suggested that psychological detachment is related to recovery from work stress. Therefore, Kinnunen et al. 32) and Sonnentag et al. 33) consider recovery experiences during non-work time to be mediators between work characteristics (e.g., demands and resources) and well-being outcomes. Psychological detachment is based on Meijman and Mulder 25) effort-recovery (E-R) model, the main premise of which is that effort expenditure at work is associated with stress responses. In optimal conditions, stress responses return to pre-stressor levels during off hours, and employees completely recover before the start of the next day 29) . If employees psychologically detach themselves from work during non-work time, the likelihood that the employees will be able to recover from the demands of work increases 29) .",

Sonnentag 26) referred to the experience of high job stressors, high need for recovery, and low propensity to rest as the recovery paradox. The recovery paradox can be explained as the following: (1) high state regarding to negative effect, which in turn has a strong effect on sleep and psychological detachment; (2) depletion of energy resources that are relevant for physical exercise, psychological detachment, and sleep; and (3) constant connection to technology and work. Employees in stressful jobs are more likely to work during non-work time and turn to their mobile devices 26, 50) . Thus, using mobile devices during non-work time provides a behavioral pathway that links high job stressors with low psychological of the perceived lack of psychological detachment experienced through cognitive irritation as a mediator between perceived privacy and sleep problems. All hypotheses were supported. The mediation analysis revealed that perceived privacy had a negative effect on the likelihood of a homebased teleworker experiencing sleep problems and that this association was negatively mediated by cognitive irritation (the perceived lack of psychological detachment).",

Studies such as ours will assist in increasing scientific understanding of perceived privacy and perceived privacy's effect on health among home-based teleworkers. It can be assumed that people now recognize that WFH is a proven and accepted extended workplace in the market economy, and future research should increasingly address the effects of WFH and their design [55] [56] [57] . Future research should also address the recovery paradox in regarding to WFH, especially when work stressors are high. Therefore, further research is needed regarding home-based telework and recovery strategies, such as playful work design, 34) mindful exercises, and short breaks 26, 37) to prevent sleep problems among home-based teleworkers.",
