            "text": "Globally, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 59 million people and killed more than 1.39 million. Designing and monitoring interventions to slow and stop the spread of the virus require knowledge of how many people have been and are currently infected, where they live, and how they interact. The first step is an accurate assessment of the population prevalence of past infections. There are very few population-representative prevalence studies of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and only two states in the United States-Indiana and Connecticut-have reported probability-based sample surveys that characterize statewide prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. One of the difficulties is the fact that tests to detect and characterize SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus antibodies are new, are not well characterized, and generally function poorly. During July 2020, a survey representing all adults in the state of Ohio in the United States collected serum samples and information on protective behavior related to SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) . Several features of the survey make it difficult to estimate past prevalence: 1) a low response rate; 2) a very low number of positive cases; and 3) the fact that multiple poor-quality serological tests were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We describe a Bayesian approach for analyzing the biomarker data that simultaneously addresses these challenges and characterizes the potential effect of selective response. The model does not require survey sample weights; accounts for multiple imperfect antibody test results; and characterizes uncertainty related to the sample survey and the multiple imperfect, potentially correlated tests.",

One is what fraction of the population has been infected and is thereby potentially less susceptible or even immune to future infection; two is what fraction of the population is currently infected and potentially infectious to others. Together with a basic understanding of the infection process, this information roughly characterizes the potential for the epidemic to grow. However, in the early months of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, there was great uncertainty about the number of people who had been infected due to challenges with adequate testing and asymptomatic and mild cases. Due to this uncertainty, debate occurred over whether the past infection prevalence was far higher than recorded cases suggested, even potentially approaching herd immunity thresholds, believed to be 70 to 85%. A populationbased estimate of past infection prevalence was of critical importance to public health officials and policy makers who have the responsibility to manage the epidemic, make policy, and protect the public.",

Basic epidemiological information to describe the pandemic is scarce because the virus is new and the pandemic exploded rapidly. In its place is a wide variety of indicators based on convenient, mostly nonrepresentative, or indirectly related datacounts of all-cause deaths (e.g., refs. 2-4), facility-based testing results for symptomatic patients, nonrepresentative samples, and in many situations, results from inadequately characterized tests that perform poorly (5) . Franceschi et al. (6) identify 37 SARS-CoV-2 prevalence studies from 19 countries. Most present results are from nonrepresentative, otherwise special, or very small study populations. Just 14 represent large-enough populations to be of policy interest-national or state level-and use a probability-based sample from a credible sampling frame to Significance In July 2020, there was great uncertainty around the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite its vital importance for public health policy, knowledge about the cumulative incidence of past infections was limited by challenges with diagnostic testing and the presence of mild or asymptomatic cases. Within this environment, competing narratives emerged around the prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infections, which would have had differing policy implications. To address this, in July 2020 a populationrepresentative household survey collected serum for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection in Ohio in the United States. This study describes a Bayesian statistical method developed to estimate the population prevalence of past infections accounting for the low positive rate; multiple imperfect diagnostic tests; and nonignorable nonresponse.",

Further complicating analysis, there were few positive tests among those who did respond-Indiana: 47/3, 658 = 1.3% for the PCR test of current infection and 38/3, 658 = 1.0% for antibody test of ever infected and Connecticut: 23/567 = 4.1% for the antibody test of ever infected. Both studies described concern that the nonresponding participants were likely to be at higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Third, the imperfect and poorly characterized antibody tests potentially add a lot of uncertainty that must be reflected in the results, particularly in low-prevalence settings (21) . Fourth, when results from multiple tests with different performance characteristics are combined, the joint result must be accurately described and its uncertainty propagated to the final estimate of prevalence-importantly, including the possibility that results from individual tests are correlated.

Our approach will be based on combining a fixed effects framework for modeling conditional dependence across multiple diagnostic tests (22, 23) with a model-based analysis using multilevel regression and poststratification (24) to acknowledge the complex design aspects of the survey.",

The survey sampling scheme was designed as a stratified two-stage cluster sample. Strata were defined by eight administrative regions used by the state. Within each region, 30 census tracts were randomly selected with probability proportional to size (PPS) based on total population size. Then, within a selected tract, five households were randomly selected, and one adult (at least 18 y of age) within each household was randomly selected to participate in the study from all eligible adults in the household using a random number generator. Adults were eligible for the study if they were aged 18 y or older, slept in the home at least 4 d of the last 7 d, were proficient in English or Spanish, were willing to provide blood and nasopharyngeal swab samples, and were able to provide consent. If the selected individual declined to participate, the team moved to the next selected household. Thus, the planned target sample size was 1,200 participants. The study was conducted from 9 to 28 July 2020. The Ohio Department of Health (ODH) Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviewed and approved the research.

The main reason we chose a fixed effects model for the test results was because it is directly determined by test sensitivity and specificity. This allows us to transparently incorporate prior information using the validation data on the package insert (26-28) (as of October 2020) for each test. Each validation study examined test performance on a set of patients with known past infection status, generating a 2 \u00d7 2 table of true infection status by the test result. Using Beta(\u03b1, \u03b2) distributions, the mean is \u03b1/(\u03b1 + \u03b2), and the variance is scaled by (\u03b1 + \u03b2). Commonly, Beta prior distributions are parameterized as hypothetical binomial experiments with \u03b1 successes of \u03b1 + \u03b2 trials. Here, rather than using a hypothetical experiment, we can directly use the validation data from the 2 \u00d7 2 tables on the package inserts. For sensitivity, \u03b1 is the number of true positives, and \u03b2 is the number of false negatives. For specificity, \u03b1 is the number of true negatives, and \u03b2 is the number of false positives. For the Epitope IgM test, there were no false positives, so \u03b2 was set to 0.1 since it must be greater than 0. This sets the mean of each distribution at the observed value with variability according to the size of the validation study. Based on this information, we let Fig. 1 . The remaining parameters for the diagnostic testing part of the model are the covariance parameters. We enforce necessary constraints on these parameters by specifying independent uniform prior distributions for each parameter restricted to its allowable range (22) .

Through the Bayesian paradigm, we are also able to incorporate external information through informative prior distributions and provide exact inferences for the prevalence estimates.

Similar results are also observed in sensitivity analyses that separately consider each type of antibody. Thus, even in hypothetical scenarios with large selective response and low estimated test sensitivity, we conclude that the majority of Ohio adults still remain susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Typically, one might rely on a single test or the creation of deterministic rules that combine test results to assess positive cases. In contrast, we utilized existing methodology for combining the results of multiple diagnostic tests to fully incorporate information on infection status from each test. We then connected the estimated infection status to a multilevel regression and poststratification approach for generating population-based estimates. Through our fully Bayesian, model-based analysis, we are able to appropriately propagate uncertainty and provide exact inferences while synthesizing the information from each type of test administered. Our approach allows us to make full use of the data collected by the survey while also accounting for its quality.

A future study should consider oversampling high-risk subgroups or regions to enable inference specific to those important populations. Nonresponse was a major issue that was addressed in the field using all available resources. We do not have detailed information on nonresponders that could have been incorporated into a more sophisticated model for missing data. However, based on our sensitivity analysis, we do not believe the substantive policy implications of the study would change based on a more complicated missing data model.
