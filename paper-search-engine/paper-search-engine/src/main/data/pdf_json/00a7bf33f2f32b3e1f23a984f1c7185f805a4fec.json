[1, 2] While preliminary reports from the United Kingdom and Europe suggest VOC infections are more severe, there is a paucity of North American evidence. [3, 4] The third wave of COVID-19 in Canada occurred between February and May 2021 and was driven by shown to exhibit higher risks of mortality (approximately 64% in a UK case-control study) [5] and hospitalization (approximately 70% in the European Surveillance System data for the first 10 weeks of 2021) [6] . However, the UK study [5] relied solely on community tests, omitting as many as 70% of COVID-19 deaths occurring in patients diagnosed after hospital admission, and in the European study [6] less than 1% of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens were sequenced for variants. A pre-print from Denmark also reported higher hospitalization rates with the Alpha variant, but was based on only 128 (of 1235 total) hospitalizations and the difference was only detected in adjusted analyses. [7] Thus, questions remain, and to our knowledge nothing has yet been published on disease severity or trajectories (ie. timing of hospitalizations or death) with VOC compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 clade in North America, crucial information for health system planners.",

However, given that the third wave in Canada affected younger patients more than the first two waves (at least partially due to vaccination eligibility criteria in early 2021), we also found that the overall COVID-19 case fatality rate was 30% lower in the third wave compared to the earlier waves, even though hospitalization risk increased by over 40%. Our finding that individuals infected with a VOC were more likely to require hospitalization than those with wild type SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with reports from Europe of a higher hospitalization risk with the VOC (over 80% of which were Alpha in those studies).

[9, 10] While genomic monitoring for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs is crucial, [11] we believe it is equally important to describe disease expression and outcomes among patients infected with VOC to fully understand both the disease phenotype and the anticipated burdens for the healthcare system. Although preliminary data regarding the effectiveness of current vaccines against hospitalization and death from the VOC are encouraging, [12] [13] [14] continued assessment of disease severity phenotypes in different jurisdictions in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals and as VOCs evolve is important.",

As with other studies comparing VOC and non-VOC infections, our sampling frame may result in overestimates of absolute risks since minimally symptomatic patients are less likely to be tested. However, we examined all positive community cases, which is less biased than studying only hospitalized cases (which prior studies have done) and sample positivity rates were similar in all 3 waves (approximately 5%). Unfortunately, the duration of the pre-symptomatic stage (and the frequency of asymptomatic cases) with different SARS-CoV-2 clades are not yet described and cannot be assessed using our dataset. Finally, although we do not have data on vaccination status in our dataset, initial vaccine roll-out in Canada in January and February 2021 focused on long term care residents, the very elderly",
