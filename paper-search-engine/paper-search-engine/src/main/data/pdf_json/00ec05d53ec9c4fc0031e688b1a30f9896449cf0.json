            "text": "Up to one person in a population of 10,000 is diagnosed once in lifetime with an encephalitis, in 50-70% of unknown origin. Recognized causes amount to 20-50% viral infections. Approximately one third of affected subjects develops moderate and severe subsequent damage. Several neurotropic viruses can directly infect pyramidal neurons and induce neuronal death in cortex and hippocampus. The resulting encephalitic syndromes are frequently associated with cognitive deterioration and dementia, but involve numerous parallel and downstream cellular and molecular events that make the interpretation of direct consequences of sudden pyramidal neuronal loss difficult. This, however, would be pivotal for understanding how neuroinflammatory processes initiate the development of neurodegeneration, and thus for targeted prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Here we utilized adult male NexCre-ERT2xRosa26-eGFP-DTA (= 'DTA') mice for the induction of a sterile encephalitis by diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation of cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons which also recruits immune cells into gray matter. We report multifaceted aftereffects of this defined process, including the expected pathology of classical hippocampal behaviors, evaluated in Morris water maze, but also of (pre)frontal circuit function, assessed by prepulse inhibition. Importantly, we modelled in encephalitis mice novel translationally relevant sequelae, namely altered social interaction/cognition, accompanied by compromised thermoreaction to social stimuli as convenient readout of parallel autonomic nervous system (dys)function. High resolution magnetic resonance imaging disclosed distinct abnormalities in brain dimensions, including cortical and hippocampal layering, as well as of cerebral blood flow and volume. Fluorescent tracer injection, immunohistochemistry and brain flow cytometry revealed persistent blood-brain-barrier perturbance and chronic brain inflammation. Surprisingly, blood flow cytometry showed no abnormalities in circulating major immune cell subsets and plasma high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) as proinflammatory marker remained unchanged. The present experimental work, analyzing multidimensional outcomes of direct pyramidal neuronal loss, will open new avenues for urgently needed encephalitis research.",

The underlying origins of encephalitis are multitude, and include infectious causes, comprising viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic agents, but also toxic, metabolic, (para)neoplastic and autoimmune or rarely post-immunization etiologies [29, 40, 42] . World travellers for example may be exposed to a variety of neurotropic pathogens leading to 'exotic' causes of central nervous system (CNS) infections [22] . Interestingly, increasing evidence points to genetic reasons of mild encephalitis which may often escape recognition until progressed age [17, 20, 37] . In about 50-70% of encephalitis cases, an etiologic agent is never identified, presumably due to the broad range of possible underlying origins and limitations in contemporary diagnostic testing, but likely also because of continuing pathogenetic dynamics in the absence of the formerly inducing agent [22, 29, 40, 42] .",

Within each trial, for the first 5 min, mice stayed in a circular partition (19 cm diameter) to prevent immediate exploring of the SocioBox (initiation stage). After lifting of this partition, mice were allowed to freely explore the SocioBox for another 5 min (interaction stage). While the 5 inserts in the outer ring were empty during all 3 habituation trials, they contained a mouse each for interaction purposes (\"stimulus mice\" or \"stimuli\"). For both exposure trials, the same 5 stimulus mice in the same position and order were used. For the final recognition test, one stimulus mouse was replaced by a new stimulus mouse (\"stranger\"), unknown to the test mouse.

In short, for SocioBox experiments (performed with 3 \u00d7 tamoxifen mice), an A655sc infrared thermography camera (FLIR) was mounted 110 cm above the arena, recording images at 640 \u00d7 480 pixels and framerate of 2 Hz (habituation 3, exposure 1 + 2) and 5 Hz (memory test), via ResearchIR (FLIR Systems, Oregon, USA) and connected to a computer located in a separate room. Extraction of thermal data was done using OpenCV 4 in Python 3.6. Images were loaded and normalized to values between 0 and 255, with higher values meaning higher temperatures. The SocioBox arena in which the test mouse was allowed to move was defined as the relevant ROI for extracting thermal data. To keep only thermal data from the test mouse, a binary mask for whole body (including tail) was created by applying intensity thresholding and processing steps to decrease image noise. By doing so, one large cluster of connected pixels within this ROI could be detected, constituting the contour of the mouse. Due to the shape and temperature differences, the whole-body area could then be segmented into a central body and a distinct tail area, and the mean temperature of each of those 2 areas could be extracted. Analyzed parameters were temperature changes over time of test mice, latency and duration of interaction with stimulus mice and \"strangers\" and visits to interaction zones. The Centralization Index (ratio body/tail temperature = T ratio) was used as continuous temperature measure [39] .",

After 4 h, mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused. Brains were collected, frozen on dry ice, weighted and lyophilized. Dentate gyrus and CA region exhibited a clear rarefaction, making these regions in DTA mice almost undetectable. b Volumetric comparison of various brain regions. DTA mice showed atrophy of olfactory bulb, whole cerebrum (without hippocampus and ventricles), hippocampus, and cerebellum. c Comparison of Jacobian determinants. Maps of z-score derived from the comparison of Jacobian determinants, overlaid on the study template, revealed lower volume of the cortex (particularly in the region of layer V), the hippocampus and its projection regions in DTA mice compared to controls. A z-score lower than -2.57 corresponds to a false discovery rate lower than 1%. d-f Comparison of vasculature and perfusion by IVIM-MRI and DSC-MRI. DTA mice showed higher cerebral blood volume in the hippocampus as shown independently by IVIM-MRI d and DSC-MRI e. In addition, the vascular volume fraction was enhanced in the cortex of DTA mice. The cerebral blood flow f was increased in all analyzed brain regions. g Comparison of brain water content, determined by IVIM-MRI: Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was increased in cortex and hippocampus of DTA mice, indicating higher water content in brain regions particularly affected by diphtheria toxin expression; MRI data from 6-8 mice/group, mean \u00b1 SD presented. h Molecular quantification of brain water, dry brain mass and blood brain barrier function in additional DTA and control mice at 2 months after encephalitis induction. Using this independent method, brains of DTA mice showed again higher water content and decreased brain mass. Increased extravasation of Evans blue and fluorescein indicate lasting blood-brain-barrier dysfunction; data from 5 mice/group, mean \u00b1 SD given; 2-tailed unpaired Welch's corrected t-tests or Mann-Whitney U-tests. All experiments in Fig. 3 After lyophilization, dehydrated brains were weighted to obtain dry brain mass and to calculate brain water content.

            "text": "After destruction of substantial numbers of pyramidal neurons, hippocampal learning and memory, determined by the classical MWM, was highly significantly affected in encephalitis mice of both induction schemes (Fig. 1e-f and Tables 1,2). In the 5 \u00d7, but not the 3 \u00d7 tamoxifen group, the open field performance reflected behavioral pathology with reduced overall mobility and dampened natural drive to prefer the periphery ( Fig. 1g ; Tables 1,2 ). Both escape latency and enhanced time spent in the middle zone may additionally be related to the slower motion/reduced total distance. The PPI data in 5 \u00d7 mice demonstrated also (pre)frontal network dysfunction ( Fig. 1h ; Table 2 ). On top of these expected behavioral changes, we addressed novel readouts of social behavior, suspected to reflect CA2/CA3 destruction in our model, and known to play a role in human viral encephalitis [4, 35] . We tested in the 3 \u00d7 tamoxifen mice social recognition memory, employing our recently developed SocioBox, and combined it with thermography ( Fig. 2a-b ; Table 1 ). The SocioBox test is superior to other presently available social recognition tests, successfully addressing multiple social contacts in parallel [23, 39] . We noted overall hyperactivity in the SocioBox memory test displayed by DTA mice, from total distance traveled to social interactions, including increased total interaction time and visits to the interaction zone, combined with a trend of shorter initial latency to interaction zone and time/visit (Fig. 2c) . Surprisingly at first view, the latency to meet the stranger was reduced in DTA mice (Fig. 2d) . The following readouts, however, clarified that this reduced latency was by no means a signal of better social memory. Comparing the behavior towards acquainted conspecifics (stimuli) versus the stranger confirmed that DTA mice were not able to distinguish between them, whereas control mice discriminated well (Fig. 2e) , explicitly indicating social cognition deficits of encephalitis mice. For better comprehension of this novel test paradigm, we provide supplementary videos, showing a healthy control mouse. The video on the left illustrates the centralization index. The video on the right demonstrates the SocioBox with the test mouse in the middle, surrounded by 5 stimulus mice. The stranger mouse is encircled. Note the experimentator's arm in the middle of the video when partition lifting takes place.",

The distinct thermographic changes in this situation, resulting from stress-related blood flow alterations via reactive vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively, suggested the concomitant screening of body/tail temperature during SocioBox performance in our model. Interestingly, upon CNS inflammation, both on experimental autoimmune encephalitis in rats and human limbic encephalitis, evidence of thermoregulatory and autonomic dysfunction has been reported [2, 46] . In our thermography approach, the Centralization Index (ratio body/tail temperature = T ratio; see supplementary video) serves as whole body stress readout and convenient measure of potential autonomic dysfunction. Indeed, encephalitis mice (3 \u00d7 tamoxifen) showed altered thermo-responses as compared to controls. Whereas during habituation 3, no appreciable dissociation in the thermo-curves appeared yet, DTA mice revealed higher centralization values in exposure 1 before partition lifting, perhaps pointing to an initially higher 'non-specific' agitation/stress. In both exposure 2 and memory test, the DTA mice thermo-responded in an overall blunted fashion compared to controls. In fact, a highly interesting thermo-pattern was observed in healthy mice that showed from exposure 1 over 2 to memory test a strong thermo-response, likely reflecting rising anticipation of partition lifting (Fig. 2f-j) . The complete lack of this amazingly robust and fast experience-induced thermo-response in the sense of an 'autonomically expressed short-term memory' , uncovered altered vasoactivity in peripheral and core body regions as indication of autonomic dysfunction and/or compromised short-term memory in DTA mice.",

This phenomenon is highly interesting and will require deeper mechanistic search via experimental approaches in the future, as any clear insight from the literature [24] or from the present data is still lacking. Importantly, cerebral blood flow (DSC-MRI) was increased in all analyzed brain regions ( Fig. 3d-f ). Taking these findings together, we suggest a working model where the enhanced vascular volume, in parallel to neural tissue loss in this sterile encephalitis, reflects a 'relative' increase in vascular density rather than simple vessel dilatation.

We note that both DTA and control mice performed comparably in this short-term CRW exposure (running distance: 659 \u00b1 238 m versus 946 \u00b1 523 m, respectively, p = 0.1893). The number of parvalbumin + interneurons normalized to the respective hippocampal area showed highly significant 'relative' increases, consistent with circuit adjustments in the sense of altered inhibition. The cFos + interneurons among them, however, tended to be decreased in whole hippocampus and CA subfields, pointing perhaps to mildly compromised cellular activatability.

Within cells, it is confined primarily to the nucleus where it binds DNA and plays a role in transcriptional regulation. However, extracellular HMGB1 serves as proinflammatory cytokine. Elevated HMGB1 levels in serum and CSF have been reported in neurological infection, indicating that excessive host inflammation may be relevant to the pathogenesis of encephalitis. Beyond infections, HMGB1 has pathogenic roles during trauma and sterile inflammation, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome [14, 15, 30, 36, 44] . Thus, we followed HMGB1 plasma levels at 14 days and 2 months after DTA induction in both 3 \u00d7 and 5 \u00d7 tamoxifen mice.

We provide not only the predictable histological evidence of a dose-dependent mild to moderate encephalitis together with the expected behavioral consequences of hippocampal and (pre)frontal damage. We also deliver clearcut and easily quantifiable novel results on disturbed social cognition with pathological thermoreaction/autonomic dysfunction as well as multifaceted sophisticated MRI readouts as future endpoints of targeted therapeutic approaches.",
