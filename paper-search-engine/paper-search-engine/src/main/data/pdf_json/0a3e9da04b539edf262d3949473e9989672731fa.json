            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated illness, COVID-19, has emerged as the first global pandemic in a century. It was evident early on that older individuals were particularly vulnerable due to age and preexisting medical conditions. [1] [2] [3] [4] An outbreak in the United States at a long-term care facility (LTCF) in Washington made national headlines secondary to the high infection rates and a fatality rate greater than 25%. 5 Medical directors of LTCFs were alerted to identify quickly any suspected residents as the virus spread, infecting residents at LTCFs across the country, and leading to reports of more than 50% of the states' reported COVID-related deaths. 6, 7 Current research shows symptomatic residents at LTCFs most commonly experience shortness of breath, cough, and fever. 4 These symptoms are thought to arise after the virus enters the lungs via the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor found in the lower respiratory tract. 4, 8 For unclear reasons, some residents develop an inflammatory process in the lungs resulting in respiratory distress which requires urgent medical attention. However, not all residents want aggressive medical interventions. Frequently residents in LTCFs have advanced directives to elucidate the extent of desired treatment if they were to become severely symptomatic with a disease such as COVID-19. As a result, some LTCF residents with COVID-19 wish to remain at the facility while others seek care in a hospital.",

Opioid therapy for oxygen hunger is a well-established treatment for refractory dyspnea, particularly at the end of life. While the exact mechanism of action of opioids on dyspnea is not understood, it is thought to be multifactorial: opioids decrease respiratory drive, central perception dyspnea, activity of peripheral opioid receptors, and anxiety associated with breathlessness. 1 In March 2020, a resident at a 98-bed long-term care facility (LTCF) in West Virginia (WV) was the first confirmed COVID-19 positive LTCF case in the state. Within 48 h, 40 residents tested positive with 11 developing severe respiratory symptoms. This study examined associations between treatment received, location, and mortality in residents who experienced severe respiratory symptoms secondary to COVID-19. Early observations led to the hypothesis that outcomes would not be different based on treatment received or location of treatment.",

An infectious disease physician at the local academic medical facility was consulted via phone by the LTCF medical director and recommend treatment with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine for all residents. Vitals were monitored approximately every 4 h. Staff noted that patients would often decompensate quickly and without warning. Normal range vitals with a few liters of oxygen at 1 check would be followed by finding a hypoxic patient with oxygen saturations in the 70s or low 80s at the next. It was observed that the patients were frequently tachypneic and agitated when hypoxic. Patients displaying agitation despite use of non-rebreather at 10 L were given morphine (Roxanol) to help with the dyspnea. 9 Morphine (Roxanol) dosing varied among patients but was titrated to comfort. It was noticed that after achieving comfort, the patients' respiratory rate and oxygen saturations improved into the upper 80's to low 90's. Additionally, as the patient's agitation decreased, their ability to tolerate supplemental oxygen therapy improved. Treatment with palliative opioids and nonrebreather oxygen continued until the patient improved or expired. The average duration of treatment was 24 to 48 h.",

It is thought opioids improve dyspnea by decreasing a patient's respiratory drive, central perception of dyspnea, and anxiety. 1 Breathlessness and anxiety were common among residents with severe symptoms and many LTCF residents had a diagnosis of dementia which can exacerbate confusion, agitation, and delirium in any acute illness. Titrating opioid therapy resulted in normalization of oxygen saturations and respiratory rates. Subsequently, opioidtreated resident survival at this facility was 87.5% during the acutely symptomatic phase, higher than expected given extensive reports of low survival rates at LTCFs. 2 Mortality of acutely symptomatic LTCF residents receiving palliative opioids was proportionally lower and trended toward significance compared to those who did not receive palliative opioids and were intubated. Although not significant, it suggests hospitalization may not improve survival over palliative care at a LTCF. This finding may also have cost implications for the resident and health care system as the cost difference between a day in a LTCF versus ICU can easily be $10,000 in acute illness. 2, 3 With this knowledge, families and residents families could take comfort in a familiar environment surrounded by staff they knew and potentially no difference in outcomes.",

Ultimately, more research with larger sample sizes is needed to better understand the outcomes of residents treated at an LTCF with palliative opioids versus those hospitalized. At the time of this reported outbreak, azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine were the standard, but newer data suggest that other medications (such as steroids and remdesivir) lead to better outcomes. 4, 5 The current treatments may impact LTCF resident survival and alter the consideration of treatment with palliative opioids in residents afflicted with COVID-19.",
