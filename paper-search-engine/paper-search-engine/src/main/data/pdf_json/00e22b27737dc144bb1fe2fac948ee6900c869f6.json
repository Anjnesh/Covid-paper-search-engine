Participants described the emotional distress of losing physical function and having a threatened future because of poor prognosis. Keeping up with constant changes in symptoms and feeling unsupported by the healthcare system added to emotional distress. Finding hope and positivity, exerting some control, being kinder to oneself, and experiencing support from others were helpful strategies for emotional wellbeing. Conclusion: We provide an in-depth understanding of what impacts emotional distress and wellbeing and discuss implications for psychological interventions for people with MND and their family. Any communication and support provided for people with MND and their caregivers, needs to pay attention to concepts of hope, control, and compassion. Article summary (Strengths and Limitations): \uf0b7 This study focuses on the experience of emotions in people with MND and their caregivers and provides an in-depth account of what impacts emotional distress and wellbeing. \uf0b7 Purposive sampling and flexible recruitment strategies used to capture experiences of emotional distress and wellbeing from people with MND with various symptoms and at differing lengths of time since diagnosis.",

(7) PwMND also experience other forms of emotional distress besides anxiety and depression including feelings of hopelessness (8) (9) (10) and demoralization. (2) Emotions are also affected by low self-esteem, (4, 11) end of life concerns, (8) faith/existential concerns, (12, 13) sense of loss, (13, 14) and changes in identity, roles and relationships. (11, 13, 15) Qualitative research on experiences of living with MND has also described the impact of the significant losses that come with MND on personal, social and occupational relationships. (10) Family members or caregivers of pwMND often struggle with the emotional impact and burden of the disease, and have high rates of psychological morbidity. (16) (17) (18) Qualitative studies with caregivers have described the strain from caring tasks, from having to make changes to their own lives and not having time for themselves. (19) (20) (21) In terms of wellbeing, psychosocial factors like coping strategies and social support, are more strongly related to wellbeing and quality of life than demographic and clinical factors. (11, 22, 23) There have however, been few effective psychological interventions to improve psychological wellbeing,(24) and more research and interventions are needed. potential factors that may impact distress or wellbeing. One study examined the use of metaphors to express emotions, (25) and a small number have focused on emotions at specific time periods (e.g. during diagnosis or the final stages). (6, 14, 26) It is also important to understand the experiences of emotions and coping among people whose experiences are not yet well represented in research, especially people with speech difficulties, cognitive impairment, and people at different stages of the disease.

Our findings come from 4 a diverse sample, thereby highlighting key triggers of distress and coping strategies used by 5 people with different abilities, symptoms and at different stages of having MND. PwMND 6 and caregivers use coping strategies differently but still rely on similar concepts (hope, 7 positivity, control, self-kindness, social support) to improve emotional wellbeing. Some of our findings are in line with previous MND research, such as the distress caused by 10 loss of ability and threats to the future.(10,14, 15, 32)  We also know that distress can be 11 caused through not receiving appropriate professional support.(6,7,26,33) We highlight the12 emotional distress triggered by multiple and constant changes brought about by disease 13 progression and constantly 'playing catch up.' This is a new finding in terms of emotional 14 distress for pwMND, but has been described in the literature around caregiver 15 experience;(34-36). This finding is important for intervention development, and we need to 16 ensure that interventions are perceived as manageable, not burdensome. 17 18 Coping strategies are important for emotional wellbeing,(23, 37, 38) and hope and control are 19 particularly important for MND.(10, 32, 39-41) Soundy and Condon (2015) show how 20 concepts of hope and control are linked to each other, and can affect mental wellbeing in 21 MND.(10) Our findings highlight the complexities of using hope and control in a disease 22 where this is constantly being threatened, and provide examples of how pwMND and 23 caregivers use hope and control to improve wellbeing. For example, we found that many 24 people use meaning-based coping strategies (finding hope and positivity in the face of 25 difficult circumstances and reappraising them in a positive way), which generates positive",

This has implications for support services, especially in providing 5 options for care, equipment and communication aids.(43) With MND, thinking about the 6 future can be distressing, but not planning for the future and not having the right support to 7 manage symptoms can also be distressing. This can be complicated for services to tailor8 support based on individual's level of readiness, but support, including psychological 9 support, needs to be flexible to meet this variability in need.(44) Our findings also point to 10 the potential usefulness of mindfulness-based and compassion-focused therapy for pwMND 11 and their caregivers. 12 Strengths and Limitations 13 We aimed to recruit a diverse range of participants and succeeded in sampling people with 14 different symptoms of varying severities, particularly people with difficulties speaking. 15 However, we did not manage to recruit many people with mild cognitive impairment and 16 could have benefitted from a more targeted sampling approach.

Some participants also spoke about experiencing such worries about the future even if symptoms had not progressed or were relatively stable. This was true particularly just after diagnosis, where worries about the future led to feelings of depression, low mood and withdrawal from others.\"Even though physically, say that first month afterwards, there was almost no change but my mind's thinking quite morose almost. You almost think of death at that point... It's not even anger at that stage, it's just hopelessness at that point because you're just thinking oh that is it isn't it? It's all over.\"The uncertainty of the disease progression also caused emotional distress among both patients and caregivers, because of being unable to manage symptoms or plan for the future.Participants discussed how the timing and relentless nature of changes in symptoms was difficult physically and emotionally. As time went on, for some it became easier to fall into a care routine. However, if deterioration happened quickly, both patient and caregivers expressed that it was difficult to cope and left them feeling tired, not in control and in need of respite.\"If something's difficult, we find a way round it. And by the time we've found a way round it, things have moved on again, and it doesn't work. So that's Sometimes physical symptoms necessitated changes in many areas of life. This included changes to their home, work, social and leisure activities. Both pwMND and caregivers spoke about the effort involved in either living with MND or looking after someone with MND. anxiety, tiredness or strain/burden. For example, C03, a caregiver, recalled being upset and needing someone to talk to due to exhaustion from physically moving her spouse; \"I used to get so tired that sometimes when he had gone to bed in the evening I did just feel like Participants reported feeling distressed when healthcare professionals or the care system did not support their needs. Infrequent or inefficient care provision left people feeling abandoned and left on their own to deal with MND.\"I felt completely unsupported by the neurologist or the health service, we were really just left on our own, completely in the dark as to what was gonna happen... So, it was a very, very distressing time.\" (Person with MND, P14)Poor coordination between different professionals/organizations, difficulty accessing equipment and financial benefits also triggered feelings of frustration, injustice and being 'let down' by the system. or insensitive communication from healthcare professionals added to emotional distress. In particular, participants described upset as a consequence of a lack of empathy from professionals, or insensitive or unsupportive presentation of care.\"Our life was shattered in 2 minutes. And I felt that was cruel, very very cruel[pause]. There should be a way of discussing it with you and saying \"well look, you have such and such a condition, but hey, this is what we can do.\" Not just you've got this and throw you out, and so we had to find our own way Despite the many losses, participants actively found ways to introduce hope and positivity.For many people, acceptance of MND was a gradual, learned process and even once there was acceptance, an attitude of not giving up on life was important for coping (acceptance and not giving up). For some, not giving up included hoping for a cure or trying alternative therapies. For others, not giving up included finding solutions to make life easier, and not letting MND define them as they continued normal and valued activities. This strategy was endorsed mainly by pwMND.Despite severe losses of function, many participants continued doing activities that they enjoyed and that were meaningful. Planning ahead and having things to look forward to in the immediate future added to feelings of hope.Most participants tried to focus on the positive aspects of life. This strategy became difficult in the context of increasing loss, but participants still stressed that it was important.\"I'm still sad that I can't do the things that I used to be able to do. But you do learn to try and be positive about living with the condition as best you can and to live your life as well as you can.\" (Person with MND, P14)To stay positive and deal with negative emotions, participants tried to reframe difficult situations by focusing on what they still can do, using humour, feeling grateful for symptoms they did not have or feeling lucky because of their circumstances or because of the support control in very different ways. One way was by focusing on the present moment and making the most of what they could currently do. This strategy was adopted mainly by pwMND; it stopped them from worrying about the future or feeling sad for what they could no longer do, Some participants described how it was helpful to exert control over decisions about their care, organizing or planning care and taking a more active problem-solving approach. This gave people a sense of empowerment when they would otherwise be struggling to cope, and also helped people hold onto their independence or identity despite the loss.\"I hate the fact that I can't talk. Although I can talk, but it's a bit drained and doesn't sound like me. But I've done voice banking and I think you've got to be a step ahead.\" (Person with MND, P19) However, some people exerted control by avoiding interactions or information that might remind them of future symptoms or deterioration and associated negative emotions. Everyone's different, aren't they? And their MND is different. Some people like to know the ins and out, but I don't know, I like to bury my head in the sand. Because I know that I would sit and worry about it all the time. And I This strategy was mentioned by both pwMND and caregivers but for different kinds of tasks.Living with MND was often described as overwhelming and participants expressed the need for taking a break from MND. Caregivers spoke about the need to take a physical break from MND care; while pwMND spoke about taking a break from MND by doing regular activities and not thinking about MND.\"I'll have days where I deliberately avoid looking at anything and trying just Some participants also expressed the need to give themselves time and space to adjust to changes in symptoms.
