Females were more represented in all study groups, ranging from 45 out of 84 (53.6%) of all HCWs with suspected previous infections to 38 out of 56 (67.9%) of Seronegative exCOVID-19. There were no significant differences in sex distribution between study groups (p=0.256, \u03c7 2 ). Median age at T0 was 45 years (IQR 33-53), and did not differ significantly between study groups (p=0.3691, Kruskal-Wallis).

Other variables influencing the antibody response were explored, with age, sex, presence of symptoms during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and time elapsed since natural infection resulting significantly associated. Finally, frequency of AE was reported, in relation to the dose received and the subgroup.A first overview of antibody status at baseline and at T1 and T2 in the whole cohort was performed with 3 different antibody tests. A prevalence of 15% was found with IgG-RBD-S, decreasing to 9% and 7.5% forIgG-N and IgM-S, respectively. The different proportions could be explained by different duration over time of each antibody class (e.g. IgM-S lasting about 2.5 months from natural infection)[10-12]. As expected, the different antibodies showed also different dynamics at T1 and T2, in relation to their target protein/domain. The IgG-N targets the nucleocapsid protein, hence it can be useful to evaluate the response to natural infection; indeed, a median value above the cutoff was observed at baseline only for group A. On the other hand, IgM-S and the IgG-RBD-S showed a significantly increasing trend across time points, that was particularly marked for IgG-RBD-S, which include neutralizing antibodies. The presence of antibodies at baseline influenced the response to the vaccine. Indeed, those with history of natural infection and positive serology at baseline (Seropositive exCOVID-19) showed significantly higher IgG-RBD-S levels compared to those with the same history but negative serology at baseline (Seronegative exCOVID-19), both at T1 and T2. Moreover, response of Seropositive exCOVID-19 was similar to that of HCWs without a history of previous infection but with positive serology at baseline (suspected previous infections). It is well possible that some Seronegative exCOVID-19 might have been misdiagnosed with the infection (false positive PCR?), while suspected previous infections may include individuals who had infection without molecular evidence.",
