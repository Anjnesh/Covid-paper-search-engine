Thus, the objective of this study is to measure social inequality with regard to income loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece. In addition, we aim to identify the characteristics of those experiencing income loss due to the pandemic. The study uses data from the \"Public Opinion in the European Union (EU) in Time of Coronavirus Crisis. Third Round\" survey. The sample consists of 1036 individuals aged between 16 and 54 years. To measure inequality, the Erreygers' Concentration Index (CI) is calculated, using social class as the ranking variable. To identify the characteristics of those experiencing income loss, a logistic regression model is fitted using the region of residence and several demographic and socioeconomic variables as potential predictors. According to the results, social inequality does not exist with regard to income loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, our findings indicate the negative influence of the pandemic on the incomes of individuals from all social classes in Greece. According to the results of the logistic regression model, the odds of experiencing income loss are higher for residents of the Aegean Islands and Crete but also for self-employed, part-time employed, and unemployed individuals. These findings indicate the negative influence of the pandemic on Greek tourism and on sectors employing a large proportion of non-standard workers. Although inequality does not exist, a substantial proportion of those losing income due to the pandemic is in line with the global picture.",

According to Kose and Sugawara, the global economy is facing a deep recession, the first of fourteen global recessions since 1870 to be triggered solely by a pandemic [5] . As generally is the case with economic crises, in which the security and stability of individuals' personal finances deteriorate [6] , the COVID-19 pandemic is having tremendous socioeconomic impacts that include loss of household income through job loss or death of earning members, either temporary or permanent closure of small businesses, and a loss of businesses productivity [7] . Due to these negative effects, a large portion of society, mostly the more socioeconomically vulnerable, struggle to cope financially, physically, and mentally with the crisis [8] . Thus, socioeconomic vulnerability is of special importance due to its link with the risks of economic deprivation, as well as health risks [9] . Since the extent of a household's exposure to job and income losses during a recession is contingent on social class [10] , the epidemic-induced economic shock affects individuals in different ways [11] . Specifically, lower socioeconomic groups are more likely to be more severely affected by the socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic [12] .",

The reasons for why individual income matters for health includes its link with material deprivation as well as its link with restrictions on social participation and opportunity to exercise control over one's life [46] . In other terms, \"economic and social circumstances affect health through the physiological effects of their emotional and social meanings and the direct effects of material circumstances\" [47] . That is, income provides the means to acquire necessities for life, gain access to health-enhancing resources, avoid harmful exposures, and participate in normal social activities, while a low income is linked with psychosocial stress [48] . Thus, losing income is not only linked with the inability to cope with daily survival costs [49] , but it is also linked with exposure to health and safety risks, such as homelessness or food insecurity [50] . Therefore, because individuals and households are facing most of the challenges mentioned above due to the COVID-19 pandemic [51] , income support measures have been implemented in many countries including Greece.",

Although the country's economy faces a high level of uncertainty, the Greek government has implemented a broad range of measures to support households, businesses, and the economy overall in this difficult time [55] . Income support measures (i.e., state income benefits to support freelancers, self-employed people, and sole proprietors), financial support for suspended and dismissed employees, support for seasonal employees, and financial support for seasonal employees not re-hired in 2020 were applied nationwide [56] . Those employed in the tourism industry, which has been severely affected by the pandemic, were eligible to receive support in the amount of 534 \u20ac monthly if their employment contracts were suspended. To also receive the extraordinary monthly support (equal to the last unemployment allowance) from June to August 2020, seasonal tourism employees were required to: a) be employed either full-or part-time in 2019 and b) receive unemployment allowances for three months and five days from September 2019 to February 2020. To be eligible for unemployment allowances in 2020, seasonal workers in the tourism and restaurant industries were required to collect 50 social security stamps instead of 100, the previous requirement [57] . On 20 October 2020, the European Commission also approved a 450 million \u20ac Greek scheme to support tourism and transport companies, among others [58] . Furthermore, because firm size and geographic location were among the primary drivers of exposure to the COVID-19 shock [59] , on 28 September 2020, the European Commission approved 1.5 billion \u20ac for 12 impacted Greek regions to support micro and small enterprises as well as those based on islands. Crete and the Aegean Islands were included. Enterprises facing sudden liquidity shortages will receive direct grants for working capital; the amount will equal a percentage of the expenses that the beneficiaries incurred in 2019, up to 50% [58] .",
