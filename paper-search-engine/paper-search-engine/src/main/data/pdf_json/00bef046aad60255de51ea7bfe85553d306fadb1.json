Thus, it is crucial to identify reliable predictors to stratify the risk for patients with severe COVID-19 and enable timely intervention and treatment to improve prognosis.",

Therefore, circulating biomarkers related to the inflammatory status of patients are good potential predictors of the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Indeed, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio has been confirmed as a well-established biomarker for predicting poor prognosis due to COVID-19 (4) .

During infections or acute conditions, HDL-C levels decrease very rapidly (5, 6) . Low concentrations of HDL-C have been used as prognostic markers in patients with sepsis, communityacquired pneumonia and other infections (7) (8) (9) . In addition, several studies have shown that the degree of reduction in HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I can predict mortality in COVID-19 patients (10, 11) . Besides, new hematological parameters related to HDL-C, including neutrophil to HDL-C ratio (NHR) (12) , monocyte to HDL-C ratio (MHR) (13) , lymphocyte to HDL-C ratio (LHR) (14) and platelet to HDL-C ratio (PHR) (15) , have been advocated as potential new indicators of inflammation in recent studies. These biomarkers have been reported in some lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16) , stroke-associated pneumonia (17) , and pulmonary embolism (18) , despite limited studies on newly proposed biomarkers. However, how these serological biomarkers change in the peripheral blood and their clinical value in COVID- 19 has not yet been reported.",

Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between the ratios and primary outcomes. Considering the total number of critical patients (n = 67) in this study and to avoid overfitting in the model, five variables (age, sex, hospital, hypertension, and diabetes) were chosen for multivariable analysis on the basis of previous findings. Regression analysis of the parameters associated with the composite outcome was repeated in a subgroup with diabetes (n = 150). To assess the discrimination ability of each indicator for adverse outcomes, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated, and the optimal cutoff values were determined by maximizing the Youden index.

            "text": "In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we explored the association between four novel serological indicators and fatal clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Our findings suggested that low HDL-C concentration and high NHR on admission are closely associated with an increased risk of poor clinical outcome not only in all COVID-19 patients but also in the diabetes subgroup. Additionally, ROC curve analysis showed that NHR can effectively forecast the worse outcome of COVID-19. The COVID-19 outbreak has caused widespread concern, and the progression to severe illness results in high rates of mortality (40%) in patients (27) . Hence, it is essential to determine several early markers to make timely assessment as to which cases will likely become clinically severe. The critical cases showed significantly lower HDL-C concentrations than the non-critical cases in this study. Above all, decreased HDL-C concentration was associated with poor prognosis of COVID-19, which was consistent with previous studies (11, 28) . More notably, recent studies have focused on the association between HDL-C-related FIGURE 2 | Kaplan-Meier survival curves for primary composite endpoint according to NHR optimal cutoff value. A log-rank test was used to evaluate difference between groups. biomarkers and COVID-19. For example, an increased triglyceride to HDL-C ratio indicates a greater risk of worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19 (29) . Additionally, in a retrospective cohort study, a high C-reactive protein to HDL-C ratio was independently associated with an increase in mortality and poor prognosis (28) . In the present study, we investigated the leucocyte-to-HDL-C ratio, and our results suggested that elevated NHR was associated with poor clinical outcomes after adjusting for confounding factors. Several factors may contribute to the increased risks of severity related to higher NHR. First, excessive inflammation is an important features of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a series of immune responses and causes changes in peripheral white blood cells, such as neutrophilia (30) . Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines such as CRP and IL-6 can directly inhibit apolipoprotein synthesis enzyme activity, resulting in decreased ApoA-1 and HDL-C production (5) (6) (7) 31) . In this context, the cytokine storm described in COVID-19 patients might induce immune-mediated dyslipidemia, leading to reduced HDL. Our study also demonstrated that CRP and IL-6 levels were higher in the critical COVID-19 group and correlated positively with NHR ( Supplementary Tables 3 and 5) . Consequently, NHR may reflect the overactive status of the inflammatory response, which can cause multiple organ damage and death. Second, HDL-C has the ability to inhibit neutrophil activation, attachment, diffusion, and migration (32) . However, a large number of activated neutrophils can influence HDL-C composition and function by altering the structure and content of a variety of apolipoproteins (33) . Moreover, a recent study in COVID-19 patients also reported altered HDL-C composition and function during severe COVID-19. For example, paraoxonase 1 (PON-1) is less abundant on HDL particles isolated from COVID-19 patients, which may be degraded by elastase released from neutrophil activation during COVID-19 (34) . Consequently, a vicious cycle may occur in severe COVID-19 patients, with neutrophil overproduction resulting in deficiency in HDL-C and further neutrophil activation, which is detrimental to the prognosis of COVID-19. Third, the NHR has been shown to be associated with many diseases, such as metabolic syndrome (12) and cardiovascular disease (35, 36) , which are also known risk factors for severe COVID-19 (37) (38) (39) .",

One reason may be that the definition of dyslipidemia itself is rather complicated. Statin is one of the drugs most commonly used by patients with dyslipidemia. Statins have favorable antiinflammatory effects and have been suggested as adjunct therapy for COVID-19 (43) . However, our study found that plasma levels of inflammatory biomarkers were not significantly affected by statin therapy (Supplementary Table 6 ). Of note, critical patients were more likely to use statins than non-critical patients (17.9% vs. 8.8%). Although it has been reported that statins may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry by inducing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression (44) , it is also worth noting that individuals on statins were older and had a greater incidence of chronic diseases (Supplementary Table 6 ), which may explain the higher proportion of statin use in the critical group. Further studies are urgently needed to explore the efficacy of statins on COVID-19 outcomes.",

            "text": "Diabetes is a common comorbidity in patients with COVID-19 and is associated with greater disease severity and higher mortality of COVID-19 (19) (20) (21) . This may be attributed to the dysregulated immunological status and the exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine response, manifesting as higher ratios of lymphopenia and increased levels of neutrophils, serum CRP, and IL-6 in patients with COVID-19 with pre-existing T2D compared to non-diabetic patients (19, 23) . In addition, diabetic patients usually exhibit reduced HDL level (22) and impaired HDL function (45) . In view of these findings, the role of these new markers in subsets of diabetes is worth exploring. Similarly, higher neutrophil counts but lower HDL-C levels were observed in critical COVID-19 patients compared with non-critical COVID-19 patients in the diabetic population. Therefore, not surprisingly, the NHR tended to be higher in the noncritical group than in the critical group and was associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes (HR:1.076, 95% CI:1.028-1.126), after adjusting for age, sex, and hospitals. Generally, patients with diabetes show a higher degree of glycation. Glycated HDL showed much lower antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 than native HDL (46) . In addition, hyperglycemia in diabetes primes neutrophils to release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (47) which might further contribute to the cytokine storm, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and sepsis in COVID-19. Thus, diabetic patients with high NHR are more likely to develop critical illness with COVID-19 because of uncontrolled inflammation. Similar results were also seen in hypertension patients but not CHD patients (Supplementary  Tables 7-10 ). This may be due to the limited sample size and the small observed events, which limits the statistical power of this explorative study.",
