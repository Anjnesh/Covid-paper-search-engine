As geropsychologists play an increasingly vital role in healthcare service delivery for older adults, it is imperative that they develop professional competence in QI, yet there is little formal QI training aimed at geropsychologists or to graduate students pursuing geropsychology. This article aims to elucidate the importance of QI education and training in geropsychology. In line with the Pikes Peak model for training in professional geropsychology, we outline QI knowledge and skills competencies for geropsychology training and suggest a rubric for integrating QI education into academic and clinical training from graduate school to professional practice. We provide recommended readings that geropsychology educators can read to become familiar with QI or use as part of a syllabus. Finally, we offer some recommendations for how current and future geropsychologists can be leaders in quality improvement work.",

            "text": "Keywords Quality Improvement \u00b7 Competency \u00b7 Training \u00b7 Geropsychology Quality improvement (QI) is a systematic approach to the collection and analysis of healthcare data on practices and processes (e.g., wait times, screening measures, workflow, safety measures) for the purpose of improving healthcare. As shown in Table 1 , QI differs from both research and program evaluation (PE) in several significant ways. QI differs in its immediate utility to affect change within the healthcare context to meet specific patient care aims, whereas PE is often used to determine effectiveness of individual programs to best determine where resources should be allocated, and research aims to advance what is scientifically understood. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) (2001) outlined a framework for QI that includes six dimensions of healthcare performance: safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, timeliness, efficiency, and equity. QI occurs within an interprofessional context and focuses on quality indicators that measure performance in one or more of the six dimensions. For example, a falls prevention program implemented in a skilled nursing facility could be evaluated in terms of increasing safety and improving timeliness of staff response to bed alarms. In order to create meaningful, substantial, and lasting changes for the betterment of healthcare systems, it is vital that all healthcare professionals partake in QI initiatives (Batalden & Davidoff, 2007) .",

Despite these foundational efforts to promote health-service psychologists participating in QI work, the field of clinical psychology has not been at the forefront of QI efforts in healthcare more broadly (Bonin, 2018) . Moreover, education and training in QI within health-service psychology is lacking. A recent analysis of psychology postdoctoral fellowships listed in the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) database found that less than half of programs required participation in a scholarly inquiry project, which was defined as research (i.e., original research and analyses of existing data) and PE or QI (McQuaid et al., 2018) . The authors recommend practical ways to integrate QI, PE, and research into fellowship curriculum to build facility with these techniques. There have been no similar efforts made to investigate if or how QI is taught at the predoctoral or internship levels in clinical psychology training programs.",

            "text": "Recognized as a specialty in professional psychology in 2010 by the American Psychological Association, geropsychology focuses on assessment and intervention with older adults, caregivers, and family members, as well as consultation within interprofessional teams and complex care systems that serve older adults (Knight et al., 2009) . Because of geropsychologists' focus on care with vulnerable populations and their integration in interprofessional care, they should have exposure to and training in QI to better serve their patients and improve clinical processes within their interprofessional teams and organizations. In this article, we describe how QI is relevant to geropsychologists and review what is known about QI training in geropsychology. We provide guidance to clinical geropsychologists, geropsychologists-in-training, and other psychologists who work in geriatric healthcare settings, encouraging them to be leaders at the table of QI initiatives. In order to drive training in QI, we offer suggested QI knowledge, skills, and abilities for geropsychologists and geropsychology trainees. We next describe suggested QI learning and experiential activities across stages of professional development, with the aim of seeding the path to QI competence earlier in training in order to make the learning curve less steep. We provide teaching resources and readings for clinical educators to help them implement QI training. Finally, we offer recommendations and future directions for fostering improvement work within geropsychology. A detailed overview of how to conduct QI is beyond the scope of this paper; for a thorough description of QI processes and the role psychologists can play in QI work, see Bonin (2018) and other resources described later in this paper.",

            "text": "QI is relevant to the field of geropsychology for several reasons. A large subset of the population that geropsychologists serve includes the most ill, frail, and vulnerable individuals in the healthcare system. Compared to other age groups, older adults are high utilizers of healthcare and spend the most on it (Dieleman et al., 2016) . The prevalence of medical multimorbidity is high (e.g., 77% of study sample in B\u00e4hler et al., 2015) , directly impacting the rate of hospitalization, healthcare spending, and polypharmacy (B\u00e4hler et al., 2015; Dieleman et al., 2016) . Thus, QI initiatives focused on one or more of the six IOM dimensions are likely to make a significant impact on healthcare provision and utilization in the older adult population. In 2018, the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) identified specific outcome measures, including autonomy, emotional health, and caregiver burden to improve healthcare for older adults in the ways that matter most to them (Akpan et al., 2018) . Geropsychologists should build knowledge and skills in QI because improvement work is fundamental to settings that employ them, including long-term care (LTC), hospice and palliative care, home care, and primary care. QI has driven improvements in nursing homes since the Nursing Home Reform Act of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA), leading to advances in collecting and monitoring valid and reliable outcome data (Wiener et al., 2007) , reduction in the use of physical and chemical restraints (Fashaw et al., 2020) , enhanced nursing staffing policies and practices (Fashaw et al., 2020) , and implementation of person-centered care practices and culture change (Duan et al., 2020; Poey et al., 2017) . With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, rapidly implemented QI has been necessary for infection control, testing, and treatment for this LTC population (D'Adamo et al., 2020) . The Minimum Data Set (MDS), a federally-mandated comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment of nursing home residents, is part of LTC facilities' QI process. This data allows the public to compare care across different nursing homes (www. medic are. gov/ nursi nghom ecomp are). Though they may often work in a consultation role, psychologists working in LTC settings should understand how the MDS is used to inform resident care (Molinari et al., 2020) . In addition to LTC, QI occurs across the spectrum of geriatric care settings and is often driven by the six dimensions of the IOM QI framework. QI has been instrumental in improving hospice and palliative care services. End of life care QI initiatives has focused on, among others, timely assessment and management of symptoms, and tailored patient-centered assessment and intervention for spiritual and existential distress (Kamal et al., 2015) . In primary care, QI work often focuses on improving equity in population health and more effectively tracking and preventing disease or dysfunction (e.g., regular depression screening) (https:// www. ahrq. gov/ resea rch/ findi ngs/ facts heets/ quali ty/ qipc/ index. html), as well as promoting patient satisfaction and choice (Drain, 2001) . QI efforts specific to age-related concerns have targeted delivery of patientcentered integrated care for frail older adults (Vestjens et al., 2018) and improvement in documentation of advance care planning so that the care provided is effective and patientcentered (Lum et al., 2017) .",

            "text": "Geriatric-specific quality indicators are abundant and useful to be aware of, both to understand how quality care is being measured for older adults, and because there are ramifications for psychologists' billing and reimbursement for care. Geropsychologists billing Medicare or other insurance should consider how Medicare quality indicators can affect their billing and reimbursement, particularly because of the monetary incentive for documenting and monitoring these quality indicators (e.g., percent of patients with a neurocognitive disorder diagnosis who received a cognitive assessment within a 12-month period) and the impact on care quality.

Geropsychologists have led QI efforts focused on behavioral and mental health in a range of care settings. Published examples of geropsychologist-led QI work have targeted primary care settings to improve patient education and patient-provider communication in depression management (see Woodhead et al., 2013) , home-based primary care to evaluate the process and outcomes of capacity evaluations for at-risk patients (see Feng et al., 2017) , geriatric mental health settings to enhance and tailor group psychotherapy (see Jacobs et al., 2018) , and across settings during care transitions to improve suicide prevention (see Luci et al., 2020) . Geropsychologists are also driving important QI work in LTC settings both in direct QI projects and development of QI models for use in nursing homes (e.g., Hartmann et al., 2019; Mills et al., 2019; Snow et al., 2018) .",

A survey of graduates from geropsychology graduate and postdoctoral training programs found that training in scholarly inquiry was primarily in research or PE (i.e., did not include QI) . Among the 38% of respondents who were engaged in research, 34% said they were actively engaged in PE (see Moye, 2017 , for examples of PE in clinical geropsychology). Engagement in QI work was not directly evaluated. Using investigation to improve clinical care for older adults was the most common reason respondents gave for participating in research. Conversely, barriers to research included challenges balancing clinical activities with research, having writing support, and having an interdisciplinary team or other collaborators help share the work. These results suggest that QI work may help to meet some of the applied research needs of both the geriatric workforce as a whole and for individual geropsychologists' professional development, provided they have the skills they need to engage in QI.",

Of note, the Psychology Track is specifically for clinical psychologists who work at least in part with older adults but who do not have formal training in geropsychology. The program consists of a four-day intensive workshop, with three days devoted to geriatric education and the last day focused on QI training, and six months of consultation with a QI coach. This program is noteworthy because it emphasizes the importance of QI when working with older adults. In fact, a requirement of the program is that participants must complete a QI project in their work setting. The workshop's QI curriculum and methods could potentially serve as a foundation for future education and training efforts in geropsychology training programs.",

Participants in the program included medicine and pharmacy residents, gerontology nursing students, and postdoctoral psychology fellows across two non-consecutive training years. The training program consisted of multiple hour-long trainings during the first month to provide participants with foundational QI knowledge and tools. Participants then developed project ideas, formed teams, and met with their teams and assigned QI mentor twice per month to work on their projects. The training program concluded with teams presenting their work, gathering feedback from their peers and mentors, and presenting a plan for sustainability of improvement processes.

Students and trainees in both PsyD and PhD programs who are on a path to a practitioner-scientist career will find QI education and training helpful because it will equip them with the knowledge and skills to improve patient care in geriatric settings. Students and trainees in PhD programs who are on a research scientist career path may find QI training to be a valuable addition to their repertoire of research methodology. At the graduate level, educators should aim to expose students to the basics of what QI is, how it compares with research and PE, and why geropsychologists might implement it. This exposure may occur as a small portion of a larger geropsychology research methods course or within a course focusing on health issues of older adults. Graduate students who have clinical practica within a healthcare setting may have an opportunity to understand what types of QI work are being done at that setting. Internship may provide the first immersive exposure to interdisciplinary QI work, though the time demands during that training year may necessitate the intern to take more of an observatory role than one in which they are an active participant. Nevertheless, internships with major rotations in geropsychology under the supervision of a geropsychologist may allow for more structured mentoring in QI work. During clinical fellowship, the postdoctoral geropsychologist-in-training can participate in interdisciplinary QI and perhaps lead a small project.",

Virtual training may also be useful for geropsychologists in academic settings who want brief structured training in QI so that they can teach their students. Within VHA, the Geriatric Scholars Program provides an excellent example of how providers wishing to gain competence in geropsychology or geriatrics can undergo didactic training and mentorship, including the opportunity to complete a QI project within aging (Kramer et al., 2016) . A fully competent geropsychologist may then be a regular, active participant on QI projects, lead committee work, track processes and outcomes relevant to older adult patients, and provide training to psychologists and other professionals on QI work. Current geropsychology educators may be unfamiliar with QI and will, thus, require education for themselves as they prepare to teach students and trainees at the graduate, internship, and fellowship training levels. Recognizing this is likely a new area for many faculty and clinical supervisors, we compiled a list of recommended readings, as shown in Table 4 . Educators can use this reading list for a variety of purposes. First, it can serve as a primer on QI in clinical psychology and geropsychology in order to feel prepared to teach the topic to students and trainees. Second, the articles describing QI training models may help educators identify how they might teach QI to students and trainees. Third, it can serve as a reading list to be included in a syllabus, a seminar, or other meeting (e.g., journal club or group supervision). Finally, this reading list, particularly the articles describing QI examples in geropsychology, may serve as a starting point for students or trainees who are planning their own projects. Geropsychology training programs should ensure training goals align with the Blueprint for Training and Education (Health Service Psychology Education The psychologist/trainee has knowledge of:",

Publish findings in relevant journals that welcome manuscripts describing quality improvement initiatives and findings 5. Advocate for and foster geropsychologists' role in quality improvement a. Participate in quality improvement training b. Participate in broader quality efforts such as APA's Integrated Healthcare Alliance or Mental and Behavioral Health Registry as applicable, and support other geropsychologists in these efforts c. Apply for available funding for quality improvement initiatives d. Provide training in quality improvement to local staff and/or trainees, recognizing the varying levels/backgrounds in quality improvement education as well as geriatric education e. Recognize the role of leadership within one's organization as it relates to QI culture, and participate or lead local organizational committees (e.g., ethics committee) to positively influence leadership's beliefs and attitudes as it relates to continuous improvement practices f. Use your power and privilege as a geropsychologist to lead local, national, and international advocacy efforts toward healthcare justice and equity (2004) developed a self-assessment measure of proficiency in practice-based learning and improvement (i.e., ability to investigate, evaluate, and intervene to improve quality of patient care). This 10-item questionnaire was created to measure medical residents' confidence in applying QI-related skills to improve care for patients and could potentially serve as template or foundation for a geropsychology-specific QI self-assessment tool. The Quality Improvement Knowledge Application Tool (QIKAT) is a written examination tool that uses a case-based approach to measure medical residents' QI competencies (Singh et al., 2014) . The tool contains hypothetical clinical scenarios in which QI is needed to address an issue related to patient care. Examinees answer three questions that correspond to QI elements (i.e., aim of the improvement/identified goal and appropriate measurement that is linked to the aim and can detect change). The QIKAT has been successfully adapted for psychiatry residents and other medical specialty residents and, thus, could be adapted for clinical geropsychologists (Reardon et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2014) . Highlighting existing QI training opportunities, developing new QI programs, and expanding QI-related continuing education offerings may also serve to ensure geropsychologists meet competencies in QI. Existing workplace structures, such as the Yellow/Green/Black Belt Certifications as part of the LEAN Six Sigma system (www. iassc. org) and local hospital preventive ethics committees, provide a solid foundation for QI skills. Further investigation into existing QI training models for geropsychologists and geropsychology trainees could also assist training leadership with designing QI training within existing programs. Given the dearth of publications on QI training in geropsychology, an investigation of internship and fellowship training brochures would likely be the most feasible and fruitful way to gather this information, and graduate course syllabi may also provide that information.",

In the USA, COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted older Americans, particularly older Black Americans and other marginalized aging communities throughout most of the pandemic, accounting for 80% of all COVIDrelated deaths (Centers for Disease Control, 2021a, 2021b). The unprecedented public health crisis brought about by the coronavirus, followed by a deeper collective understanding of racism as a public health crisis, highlights the imperative for psychologists working in geriatric care to further the cause for safer, more equitable healthcare for older adults. QI can drive these necessary healthcare changes during the upheaval of the COVID pandemic (Mondoux et al., 2020) and can capitalize on anti-racist strategies being deployed by healthcare organizations to address inequity (Institute for Healthcare Improvement, 2020). We encourage viewing QI work as being one way to improve health equities and injustices, but acknowledge that without a critical lens, it can also have the potential to perpetuate unequal systems.
