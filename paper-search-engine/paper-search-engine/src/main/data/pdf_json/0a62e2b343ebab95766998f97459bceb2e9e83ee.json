The binding process is initiated when the receptor binding domain (RBD) of at least one protomer switches from a \"down\" (closed) to an \"up\" (open) state. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and two-dimensional replica exchange umbrella sampling calculations to investigate the transition between the two S-protein conformations with and without glycosylation. We show that the glycosylated spike has a higher barrier to opening than the non-glycosylated one with comparable populations of the down and up states.",

However, the emerging threat of variants 4, 5 and the possibility of future coronavirus outbreaks 6 necessitate a thorough understanding of the viral life cycle, including recognition, binding, and infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated by the recognition of, and binding to, the host-cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. 7, 8 This process is mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, a homotrimeric class I fusion glycoprotein that protrudes from the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. Release of the S-protein sequence in early 2020, combined with earlier structural work on related betacoronaviruses, has led to the rapid determination of structures of solublized, pre-fusion stablized S-protein ectodomain constructs [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] (Fig. 1) .",

[26] [27] [28] More recently, extensive simulations using enhanced sampling techniques such as weighted ensemble 29 and fluctuation amplification of specific traits (FAST) adaptive sampling combined with Folding@home 30 have provided details of multiple pathways for the S-protein opening. Moreover, features of the energy landscape of these conformational transitions that are necessary for viral binding and entry are beginning to emerge. 27, 28, 31 A recent study by Amaro and coworkers has highlighted the functional role of glycans at N165 and N234 beyond shielding 24 based on separate equilibrium simulations of the Sprotein down and up states. When the RBD transitions to the up state, the glycan at N234 rotates into the resulting void, stablizing the up conformation. Moreover, MD simulations and mutagenesis have revealed contributions of the glycan at N343 to the dynamics of RBD opening and ACE2 binding. 29 These results suggested a role for the glycan at N343 in the opening conformational transition via \"lifting\" the RBD through sequential interactions with multiple RBD residues, referred to as \"glycan gating\".",

This space is (Fig. 1c,d) . The down and up states from the cryo-EM structures are located in the lower-left and upper-right regions, respectively. The black line shows the MEP for each system. (c) The free energies along the MEPs of both structures were extracted and plotted against the path parameter \u03bb, which goes from 0 (down-state energy minimum) to 1 (up-state energy minimum). For the glycosylated system, the conformations from the two cryo-EM structures emerged as energy minima on the 2D potential of mean force (PMF) as expected (Fig. 2a ). The energy difference between the two minima is small, with the up state possessing a slightly higher energy than the down state by 0.4 kcal/mol (Fig. 2c) . A recent study from Simmerling and coworkers also found the down state to be of a lower energy than the up state using US with a different set of collective variables. 31 It is worth noting that the up-state energy minimum is located at the corner of the conformational space explored, and the true minimum may be beyond the explored region. This suggests that the true energy-minimum up state may be more \"open\" than the cryo-EM structure, as also found by other computational studies. 29, 30 To compensate for the missing fractions of the energy wells, we fitted Gaussian distributions to the population distribution represented by those regions of the PMF ( Fig. S4 ; see the Supporting Information). With this expansion, we determined that the down and up state populations are 54% and 46%, respectively, consistent with the population distribution determined from cryo-EM structure classification. 10, 13 We also computed the minimum energy path (MEP) 34, 35 connecting the down and up states (Fig. 2a,c) . The path is mostly diagonal on the 2D PMF, with the exceptions of a sharp increase of \u03d5 while exiting the down-state energy well and a slight decrease of \u03d5 when entering the up-state energy well. The energy barrier separating the two stable conformations has a height of 7.4 kcal/mol and is located at d = 54.9 \u00c5.",

For example, the glycan at N234 has to escape from the cavity under the RBD in the up-to-down transition. 24 We also approximated the MFPT for the un-glycosylated system. The reduced transition barrier in the PMF (Fig. 2c ) led to a concomitant reduction in the MFPT, which is 5 \u00b5s for the down-to-up transition and 305 \u00b5s for the up-to-down transition.",

For the un-glycosylated S-protein, the populations shift to 77% bound, 23% up-but-unbound, and 0% down (Fig. 3b-f ). However, removing glycans not only affects the up/down population, it also may affect the binding/unbinding rates k on and k off . Deep mutational scanning of the RBD found any mutation to N343, which eliminates the glycan bound at this position, is detrimental, with an inferred \u2206\u2206G of +0.35 to 2.03 kcal/mol. 40 Using our approximate open/close rates for the un-glycosylated S-protein but modifying the binding/unbinding rates according to the mutation data, we find that the bound-state population decreases to between 10% (\u2206\u2206G = 2.03 kcal/mol) and 65% (\u2206\u2206G = 0.35 kcal/mol).

We calculated the number of hydrogen bonds between the opening RBD-A and the rest of the protein. We found that this number decreases generally as RBD-A opens up, with a slight but distinct increase in interactions after crossing the energy barrier ( Fig. 4a,b) , both with and without glycans. The general trend is explained by the fact that RBD-A moves away from the rest of the protein when it is fully open and consequently breaks contact with the rest of the trimeric S-protein, including neighboring RBDs and S2 domains. However, this movement is insufficient on its own to explain the more drastic decrease in the number of hydrogen bonds when glycans are present.",

This observation is further supported by contact analysis, which shows that the number of contacts between the glycans at N122 and N165 and the \u03b2-sheets of NTD-B and RBD-A increases steadily as RBD-A approaches the up state (Fig. S5) .

Recently, Amaro and coworkers conducted all-atom MD simulations and mutation experiments to study the individual roles of the above glycans on Our simulations also reveal roles for the glycans at N165 and N343 in stabilizing both the up and down states. Specifically, when RBD-A is in the down state, glycans at N165 and N343 wrap around the RBM (Fig. 5a) , keeping it in the down state. A similar interaction was observed in another study when a glycan at N370 was artificially introduced; it wrapped around the down-state RBD like a \"shoelace\". 20 Remarkably, the glycan at N165 also stabilizes the up-state RBD by supporting part of the exposed RBM (Fig. 5b) . The inter-glycan contact between glycans at N343 and N165 is significantly higher in the up state compared to the down state (Fig. S10) , suggesting that the glycan at N343 indirectly stabilizes the open state by interacting with the glycan at N165 (Fig. 5b) . The two glycans also prevent the flexible RBM from attaching to the neighboring down-state RBD and becoming inaccessible to ACE2, as observed in one of our equilibrium simulations of the un-glycosylated system (Fig. S2) .",

The glycans at N165 and N343 both interact with the RBM in the down state as illustrated by the average contact values between RBD-A and glycans at N165 and N343 ( Figure S8, S9) . As the spike opens, the glycan at N165 switches to interact with RBD-A residues below the RBM, while the glycan at N343 barely contacts RBD-A after the system crosses the activation barrier of opening (Fig. 5c) retains the WT K986/V987 sequence, rather than the double proline mutations commonly made in the production of stabilized pre-fusion spike proteins; they report a shifting inwards (and, thus, tighter packing) of the S1 subunits when compared to the earlier solubilized ectodomain structures. 11 In fact, the loss of a putative salt bridge between K986 and an aspartic acid (D427/D428) on an adjacent protomer has been implicated in producing the less tightly packed structures seen in the solubilized mutant constructs. 11 In our equilibrium simulations this salt bridge has an \u223c30% occupancy, averaged over all three protomers in the two independent trajectories. Reduction in the aforementioned salt bridge occupancy originates from competing with intra-protomer salt bridges between K986 and nearby acidic residues E748, E990, and D985, present in the \u223c15-25% range, suggesting transient interaction between K986 and the RBD aspartic acids (D427/D428).

The resulting PMF has very similar features as compared to the WT one, with the up state having a higher energy than the down state and an energy barrier near the down state (Fig. S12) . Along with the transient nature of the K986/D427 salt bridge, the similarity of this PMF with WT ( Fig. 2) suggest that while the electrostatic interaction between the S2 subdomain and the RBD of the up protomer may have modulatory effects on S-protein dynamics, the major impact of the proline mutations is likely to be their tendency to break and distort \u03b1-helices. The HR1-CH turn region undergoes a large conformational change upon the transition from the pre-to post-fusion states, forming an extended \u03b1-helix. 11 The presence of the prolines, residues known to break/kink \u03b1-helices, inhibits the formation of the long \u03b1-helix characteristic of the post-fusion conformation. 42 In fact, Gobeil et al. 12 report that for the S-protein construct with the furin site removed, the presence of the prolines produces structures, ACE2 binding, thermal stability, and antibody binding that are remarkably similar to the WT K986/V987 pair. Of note, recent simulations by Wang et al. 43 exploring the transition from the pre-to post-fusion states have shown that while the WT sequence at 986/987 has a tendency to become helical, replacement with prolines disrupts the formation of this secondary structure.",

            "text": "To understand the effect of spike-opening dynamics on epitope exposure, we calculated the accessible surface area of a number of epitopes along the MEP identified from REUS. We selected seven different antibodies 16, 17, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] with epitopes spanning multiple regions on RBD-A (including cryptic epitopes) and the NTD-B of the S-protein. Details of these antibodies are provided in the Supporting Information. We performed separate antibody accessible surface area (AbASA) calculations including and excluding the glycans using the same sampling approach with a 7-\u00c5 probe. A similar probe size 19 as well as a smaller one 30 were used in previous studies. While this moderate (7-\u00c5) probe size may make some crevices appear slightly exposed, 19 it is optimal for cryptic epitopes. 30 In general, the AbASA either remains the same or increases significantly when RBD-A transitions to the up state. The epitope of the STE90-C11 52 antibody has a jump in AbASA during the closed-to-open transition. The CR3022 antibody binds to a cryptic epitope, 50 which is completely covered in the down state and is only slightly exposed in the up state. Remarkably, the AbASA of the 2-4 antibody does not change during the down-to-up transition of the RBD, in spite of the epitope being located in the RBM (Fig.   6a ). Therefore, we conclude that the entire RBM does not become exposed even in the up state. The AbASA for the epitope of the 4A8 antibody does not change significantly during spike opening since its epitope is located in the N-terminus, 17 54 Surprisingly, the epitope of the S309 antibody 51 becomes less exposed in the open state without an increase in coverage by the glycans (Fig. 6b) , indicating that a part of the RBD (Table S2 ) also become less exposed in the up state compared to the down state.",

To this end, we computed a two-dimensional energy landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein updown inter-conversion. Using multiple REUS calculations, we elucidate the collective roles of S-protein glycans in its opening dynamics. Our results indicate that the free-energy barrier of spike opening is \u223c2 kcal/mol higher in the presence of glycans compared to the fully unglycosylated spike. While the up and down populations are approximately balanced in the presence of the glycans, the up state of the S-protein becomes almost exclusively populated without glycans. One may assume more up-state S-proteins would present a higher chance of binding ACE2 receptors and hence increase its viral fitness. However, there are a few opposing effects of having more up-state S-proteins as indicated by a prior study 24 and reaffirmed by our analysis. The RBD in the down state is heavily shielded by glycans, 19, 24 while in the up state, it is more exposed to neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 6a) . Furthermore, ACE2 binding strongly depends on the binding affinity between ACE2 and the S-protein, which may involve interactions with glycans as well as protein. Therefore, a high up-state population does not necessarily reflect a high ACE2-bound-state population.",

The STE90-C11 antibody has the greatest epitope exposure when the RBD is open, while the BD-368-2 antibody has an epitope that is always significantly exposed, irrespective of the RBD's position. Additionally, the exposure of the BD-368-2 epitope is very similar to the epitope of STE90-C11 in the up state. Therefore, these two antibodies show very high efficiency in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, both with subnanomolar IC 50 values. 49, 52 The CR3022 antibody binds to a cryptic epitope; consequently, its AbASA is smaller compared to other epitopes. However, the lack of exposed surface area, even in the up state, is compensated for by strong electrostatic interactions at the epitope-CR3022 interface. 55 We analyzed interactions of individual glycans with different domains of the S-protein using the two MEPs obtained, one with and one without glycans. The glycans at N122 and N165 disrupt the hydrogen bonds between the opening RBD-A and the neighboring NTD-B, destabilizing the up state and hence pushing the equilibrium population towards the down state when compared to the un-glycosylated system. The glycans at N165 and N343 also stabilize the RBD-A down state by wrapping around the RBM. Conversely, the glycan at N343 serves as the so-called \"glycan gate\" propping up the RBM, 29 while the glycan at N165 helps by supporting the up-state RBD-A with the aid of the glycan at N343. Consequently, these two glycans stabilize both down and up states, creating a local minimum for each.",
