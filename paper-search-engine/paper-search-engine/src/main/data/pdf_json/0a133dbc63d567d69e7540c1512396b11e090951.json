For ungulates alone, over half a million wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) are recorded annually in nineteen European countries (Linnell et al., 2020) , with estimates for Europe as a whole exceeding 1 million per year . Collisions with ungulates and other large mammals represent a major source of direct anthropogenic non-hunting wildlife mortality (Forman and Alexander, 1998) and socioeconomic costs associated with human injury, death and vehicle damage (Bissonette et al., 2008; Niemi et al., 2017) . It is also an animal-welfare issue as a high proportion of animals are injured but not killed in the collision itself, are not always found and put to death, and therefore live on with injuries or die from the injuries sometime after the accident .",

Considering only mammals, roadkill is a major factor which threatens almost all large carnivores (i.e., brown bear (Ursus arctos), gray wolf (Canis lupus), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), and wolverine (Gulo gulo), in the European human-dominated landscapes (Chapron et al., 2014; Garrote et al., 2018) . Roads still present the main threat to Iberian lynx, one of the most endangered carnivores on the planet. Also, in case of European mink (Mustela lutreola), listed as Critically Endangered (CR), roadkills presented the most common human-induced cause of mortality in 1990-2008 when 91% of individuals were killed by moving vehicles (Palaz\u00f3n et al., 2012) . Data for other species groups such as lagomorphs, medium-sized carnivores (mesocarnivores) and avian wildlife are very scarce and often more unprecise and underreported (B\u00edl et al., 2017) . Rough estimates, however, suggest that in total several million individuals of these species are killed in traffic each year (Grilo et al., 2020) .",

The highest percentage reduction in WVC were recorded during the first weeks of the CRTR ( Fig. 4 and Table 2 ). Differences among countries are likely a consequence of both different lengths and the degree in the lockdown before restrictions were relaxed. In Spain, which was probably among the countries with the largest reductions in traffic, we also found one of the most significant reductions in WVC. In countries where traffic intensity seemed to return faster to the normal levels (e.g., SVN, NOR, FIN; see Fig. 2), however, we found a lower overall decline in WVC. This supports that the CRTR was the main reason for reduced WVC in Europe in spring 2020.",

The weekly development in the traffic volume indices in each country showed a quite similar development during the CRTR period, with the largest reduction in the beginning and then a gradual increase towards the normal level (Fig. 2) . The weekly development of WVC did not vary as consistently over time in all countries (Fig. 4) . This different pattern in several countries between the decrease in traffic and WVC may reflect that the indices for traffic volume in several countries do not fully reflect the actual decrease in traffic on roads with the most WVC. The relationship between WVC and traffic volume can, however, also be non-linear (Seiler and Helldin, 2006; Rolandsen et al., 2011; Jacobson et al., 2016) .

This indicates that WVC numbers in north-European countries (particularly NOR and SWE) can be heavily influenced by snow cover. Moreover, variation in temperature and climate indices has been shown to be associated with a varying number of WVC (Mysterud, 2004; Rolandsen et al., 2011) .

Across Europe, reliable data on WVC are available only for large mammals, mainly ungulates. In this study, however, the primary aim was to focus on ratios (i.e., the decrease of WVC in the CRTR period in comparison with predictions based on data from previous years), presuming that WVC recording remained more or less the same in 2020 as in past years. Therefore, our results should not be affected by underreporting. However, due to an unknown proportion of WVC that is not reported in each country, we cannot determine the absolute changes in WVC.

This is also likely to lead to increased survival and possibly larger wildlife populations. Therefore, local and temporarily limited traffic flow reduction, particularly in areas where the focus is on conservation of endangered species, may be an option to mitigate wildlife roadkills (van Langevelde and Jaarsma, 2009 ).",

Similar results are shown in a study from the United States (Shilling et al., 2021) . These studies show the negative effect of road traffic on wildlife, and how wildlife benefited from travel restrictions and reduced traffic demand in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. The reduced number of WVC most likely led to the survival of many wild animals which would, in all probability, have been killed by cars under normal traffic conditions. Future efforts to mitigate WVC are beneficial both from a wildlife conservation and human safety perspective. WVC data of sufficient quality, from several different species and countries, would provide a better basis to achieve this.",
