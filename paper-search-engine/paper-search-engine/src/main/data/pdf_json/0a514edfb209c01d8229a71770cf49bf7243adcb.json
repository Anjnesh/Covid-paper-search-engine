            "text": "In the General Theory, Keynes remarked that the economy's state depends on expectations, and that these expectations can be subject to sudden swings. In this work, we develop a multiple equilibria behavioural business cycle model that can account for demand or supply collapses due to abrupt drops in consumer confidence, which affect both consumption propensity and investment. We show that, depending on the model parameters, four qualitatively different outcomes can emerge, characterised by the frequency of capital scarcity and/or demand crises. In the absence of policy measures, the duration of such crises can increase by orders of magnitude when parameters are varied, as a result of the \"paradox of thrift\". Our model suggests policy recommendations that prevent the economy from getting trapped in extended stretches of low output, low investment and high unemployment.",

            "text": "The theory can be summed up by saying that, given the psychology of the public, the level of output and employment as a whole depends on the amount of investment. I put it in this way, not because this is the only factor on which aggregate output depends, but because it is usual in a complex system to regard as the \"causa causans\" that factor which is most prone to sudden and wide fluctuation. More comprehensively, aggregate output depends on the propensity to hoard, on the policy of the monetary authority as it affects the quantity of money, on the state of confidence concerning the prospective yield of capital assets, on the propensity to spend and on the social factors which influence the level of the money wage. Keynes [1] I. INTRODUCTION The years following 2008 were marked by the great financial crisis, and with it a crisis for economic theory [2] . As for the great depression of the 1930s, there was a failure to predict the crisis amongst economic orthodoxy. 1 Despite its failures in predicting the recession [10] or the sluggish recovery [11] , the mainstream Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) class of models have remained the core macroeconomic framework and workhorse tool of policy [12] . While calls to reform these models have been made [8, 13, 14] , the basic framework with a single rational representative agent often remains a baseline assumption when studying business cycles, although heterogeneous agents new Keynesian models (HANK) have recently been considered as well. 2 The decisions of such a representative agent, which include capital investment decisions, determine the trajectory of the economy and are based on the optimisation of a utility function with static parameters, with no space for \"animal spirits\" or confidence effects (although see [18] and the discussion below). In such models, \"dark corners\" are absent and crises can only be the result of major exogenous shocks. 3 This must be contrasted with Keynes' intuition, which, as rephrased by Minsky [20] , was that the subjective evaluation of prospects over a time horizon is the major proximate basis for investment and portfolio decisions, and these subjective estimates are changeable. Expectations can indeed be subject to rapid changes, disagreement and irrationality, as reflected in the high volatility of investment [21] , and the abrupt nature of expansions and recessions. The investor behaviour behind these swings are indeed often referred to as animal spirits or irrational exuberance [22, 23] . There is now a rich literature on irrational behaviour across economics (see [24] for a recent review). However, it has not been fully dovetailed into more traditional business cycle models. One can find some boundedly rational components in DSGE models, 4 such as [26] [27] [28] that focus on learning in expectations formation in a single-actor model, as well as [29, 30] that use various different utility specifications in DSGE. But apart from Refs. [18, 31, 32] , there is surprisingly little work attempting to factor confidence or sentiment into the DSGE framework as an explicit variable. This is despite some empirical work suggesting that consumer confidence contains important information for forecasting personal spending and consumption [33] [34] [35] .",

This feedback can amplify productivity shocks, and lead to the appearance of a second equilibrium characterised by low consumption and high unemployment, and crises resulting from self-induced confidence collapse. The existence of two very different macroeconomic equilibria has also been recently suggested in another context 2 For a non-exhaustive list of prominent examples see [15] [16] [17] . 3 \"Dark corners\" refers to a particularly insightful piece by O.",

We assume that capital and labour are essentially nonsubstitutable, and posit a behavioural rule for investment that accounts for both consumer confidence and for the quality of the returns generated by risky capital investment. This expanded framework allows us to investigate the joint dynamics of confidence, capital availability and output. In a nutshell, our model attempts to capture many of the ideas so clearly expressed by Keynes in the opening quote above, while keeping part of the scaffolding of standard business cycle models.",

This was followed by an almost immediate downfall of both investment and consumption. These stylized facts can be observed in Figure 1 . It took six years to recover to prior confidence levels, even as investment and consumption grew in the medium-term. It is difficult to believe that the Great Recession was the result of a major exogenous shock. 6 Rather, Keynes' story assigning the abruptness of the crisis to a shift in investment decisions is much more plausible. Indeed, anecdotal evidence reported by prominent actors at the time 6 [42] notes that there is no consensus narrative of the causes for the crisis. In addition, from a DSGE model perspective, [43] recently ruled out many of the common exogenous DSGE shocks as explanatory candidates for business cycles strongly suggests that confidence collapse played an essential role in the unfolding of the crisis -see the riveting account of Ben Bernanke et al. in [44] . The consumption and investment trajectories generated by our model can be grouped into four distinct categories differentiated by the prevalence of crises in consumption and the scarcity of capital for production. We recover the bi-stable behaviour obtained in Ref. [40] , alternating between enduring spells of high and low confidence. In addition, the household's investment behaviour can lead to capital scarcity, i.e. periods where capital is the limiting factor to output. During these instances there is an increased risk of a confidence collapse and an ensuing low-consumption depression where the household consumes a small fraction of disposable income and invests cautiously.",

Following a shock or deterioration in consumption to below the confidence threshold, there is uncertainty about the future economy and whether future consumption is assured. This induces the household to save more for the future, effectively reducing the current demand. Economically, c 0 is thus similar to minimal consumption: it defines the threshold beyond which there is a panic where the household's \"survival\" is in question.",

Looking at the statistics of the high consumption periods and of the low consumption periods, we conclude that the prosperous periods last a time T > of the order of T \u03b4 = 200 (data not shown), whereas crises are rather short, of the order of T < \u2248 10, see Fig. 6 , plain vertical lines in the third graph of the bottom row, which corresponds to T \u03bb = 20, i.e. \u03bb = 0.95. The full distribution of T < and of the Sharpe ratio S for \u03bd = 1 are shown in light grey, and reveals that whereas its time averaged value of S is clearly positive and equal to S t \u2248 0.71, its full distribution is uni-modal but quite broad and negatively skewed. Fig. 6 , left graphs shows the consumption crisis prevalence \u039e c and the average Sharpe ratio S as 1\u2212\u03bd (weighing confidence in the investment allocation decision) and T \u03bb are varied. One sees that decreasing \u03bd or increasing T \u03bb leads to an increase of \u039e c , at least in the range shown, T \u03bb 300. The evolution of the average Sharpe ratio is more complex, reflecting the non-trivial shape of its distribution function (bi-modal and skewed, see below). But certainly as agents pay less attention to the actual return on capital and are more affected by the level of confidence, the average Sharpe becomes strongly negative (red region of the diagram) and the economy gets trapped forever in a low consumption, low investment regime where \u03b8 k \u03a3 is negative (see Eq. (36)). Now, let us look at a cut along the direction \u03bd = 0.75, corresponding to a 25% weight given to confidence in the allocation decision, as T \u03bb is varied. For this particular value of \u03bd, the average Sharpe ratio is close to zero and only weakly depends on T \u03bb (Fig. 6, bottom left graph) . But from the bottom row of Fig. 6 , we see that when T \u03bb 10, the distribution of Sharpe ratios becomes bimodal and with a skewness that decreases as T \u03bb increases.

The first observation is due to the fact that the Sharpe ratio estimated when in a high output period is clearly in positive territory and quite insensitive to T \u03bb (see the histograms in Fig. 6 ). This means that capital supply is also independent of T \u03bb and that the confidence collapse mechanism must be identical to the one described in our previous work [40] and not triggered by a lack of investment. 14 13 For very large T \u03bb , the situation changes again, see below. 14 This is not to say that the crisis frequency is not related to capital abundance. As already noted in section III E, as capital depreciation \u03b4 increases, available capital decreases, which leads to a lowering of output ct. Since the distance between ct and the threshold c 0 is a crucial determinant of the probability of a confidence crisis, the region H k Hc becomes pervasive as \u03b4 increases, see again Fig. 4 . On the contrary, the mechanism by which confidence is restored is strongly impacted by the value of the memory time T \u03bb . When the economy is in a consumption crisis, the returns on capital are very small. Thus, averaged over a sufficiently long time period, the Sharpe ratio is well defined and also small (see the narrow peaks in the Sharpe ratio distribution in Figure 6 ). Combined with the low confidence dampener on sentiment (1\u2212\u03bd)\u00b7C t , this leads to a negligible investment flow. So whereas positive productivity shocks should put the economy back on an even keel, the level of capital is lagging, which creates a ceiling that prevents consumption (and hence confidence) from increasing substantially and returning to the high consumption case.",

For an example of these positive spikes of consumption, see top centre panel in Fig. 6 . The same effect takes place if \u03bd is increased back to 1, where only realised Sharpe affects investment. In this case, the drag on capital due to low confidence levels is absent, and the system is able to pull itself out of the rut much more efficiently, leading to shorter crisis periods. But for lower values of \u03bd (higher impact of household confidence on the investment propensity), the dearth of capital in crisis periods is such that the economy is unable to ever recover, i.e. T < = +\u221e for all purposes.",

Besides monetary policy, other measures that improve confidence (e.g. central bank messaging) and/or promote investment into productive capital would have a similar impact (for instance if the government decides on strong fiscal measures that include investment into productive capital, such as through mission-oriented policies or infrastructure spending).",

As we have shown in our previous work [40] , the self-referential nature of confidence amplifies the effect of productivity shocks on output, and can lead to crises where consumption abruptly jumps from a high equilibrium level to a low equilibrium level. Depending on the parameters of the model, these crises can be more or less frequent, and the low consumption periods can be of various duration: short spikes (\"V-shaped crises\") or long drawn-out phases (\"L-shaped crises\").",

As already emphasised in our previous paper [40] , if selfreflexive feedback loops exist, then governments and monetary authorities should not only manage inflation expectations but more broadly confidence in the future prospects of the economy. Although confidence indices are routinely measured by polling institutes (see e.g. Fig.  1 in Section I), the inclusion of such indices in macroeconomic DSGE models and the importance of narratives [48] have never really been considered seriously beyond the impact of news shocks on productivity. 16 Beyond communication and narratives, our model suggests that monetary authorities should also directly promote investment, in particular during recessions. This is needed to prevent the economy being trapped in a low output, low confidence environment. Although this conclusion looks perfectly intuitive, our model reveals that a lack of capital can prolong crisis periods by orders of magnitude, and convert V-shaped crises into L-shaped crises. Boosting investment in working capital can be done through traditional channels, by lowering the riskfree interest rate (possibly making it negative) or by direct Keynesian investments in infrastructure and in innovation, which have the double effect of increasing the productivity of capital and propping up household confidence.",

The bottom row display the log 10 probability of consumption crises \u039ec as a function of the same parameters. The dark red zones correspond to the regions where \u039e k/c > 0.99, where crises are permanent. Each column corresponds to a different choice of the capital depreciation, from \u03b4 = 0.001 to \u03b4 = 0.02. We set a = 15 and \u03c3z = 0.15. As \u03b4 increases, the (H k , Hc) regimes becomes widespread. In each panel we have marked the points chosen to illustrate the different phases of the model, together with their label (see text). The dynamics trajectories and the corresponding histograms are reported inFig. 5. The two leftmost panels show another section of the phase space, varying log a and \u03c3z, with c0 = 0.017, \u03bd = 1 and \u03b4 = 0.005 fixed (the two solid dots there correspond to the same solid dots of the middle panels, in the H k Hc phase).",

The middle row presents the dynamics of capital kt (solid orange), labour nt (solid green) and Sharpe ratio St (solid grey, with levels shown on the right y-axis). The lower panels show the histograms of consumption (black dots) and labour (green crosses) in a log \u2212 log scale. The green (resp. grey) dashed curve corresponds to the \u03b4 = 0 baseline value for labour (resp. consumption), with c0 indicated as a vertical red line. In the Hc phase, the histograms of consumption and labour become bi-modal, corresponding to high output and low output regimes. For all simulations \u03bd = 1, a = 15, \u03c3z = 0.15.
