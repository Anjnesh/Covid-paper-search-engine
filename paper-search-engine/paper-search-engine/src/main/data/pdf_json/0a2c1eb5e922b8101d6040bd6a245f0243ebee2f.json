The severity of COVID-19 infection varies between a mild respiratory disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and multi-organ failure associated with an increased risk of death. The clinical course of COVID-19 is often accompanied by a hyperinflammatory response and systemic coagulation derangement, which may evolve into overt disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The systemic activation of blood coagulation and pulmonary thrombo-inflammation with local vascular damage caused by COVID-19 and other important risk factors, such as reduced mobility, may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) (1) (2) (3) (4) . Nonetheless, there is a lack of explicit indications regarding the best algorithm for diagnosing PE in COVID-19 patients (5) . In particular, it is not clear whether the most recent guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute PE, that have been developed in 2019 by the European Respiratory Society and the European Society of Cardiology (6), may be applied with success to COVID-19 patients with respiratory insufficiency. These guidelines consider the use of the revised Geneva and Wells pre-test probability scores (7, 8) a key step in the diagnosis of PE. They also suggest the use of algorithms meant to identify patients with low likelihood of having PE, such as the PE Rule-out Criteria (PERC) (9) and the YEARS clinical decision rule (10) . Also for these algorithms it is not clear whether they perform well in the COVID-19 population (11) . In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure, to determine how many of them had an indication to undergo computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) according to guideline-recommended algorithms for diagnosing PE. We also looked for differences between patients who underwent and did not undergo CTPA, to understand whether diagnostic workup for PE in COVID-19 patients is based on established criteria. Finally, we determined whether patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PE had specific characteristics that made them different from those with a CTPA negative for PE.",

Gemelli IRCCS on 19 May 2021. Inclusion criteria were: infection by SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by positive molecular assay on oral/nasopharyngeal swabs; hospitalization in non-intensive care unit (ICU) medical wards; presence of acute respiratory failure at the time of hospital admission or during hospital stay. Acute respiratory failure was defined as sudden need for oxygen supplementation in patients who did not require oxygen therapy before. All patients were on treatment with a prophylactic dose of anticoagulant since their arrival in the hospital, as established by our internal guidelines for the prevention of VTE in COVID-19 patients. Exclusion criteria were: age <18 years; full-dose anticoagulant therapy for conditions such as atrial fibrillation and/or previous venous thromboembolism (VTE). Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or number and percentage (%). Differences between groups were analyzed by Chi square test or Fisher's exact test for dichotomous variables and by Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables. Differences were considered statistically significant for P < 0.05.",

Regardless the algorithm, the proportion of patients with a theoretical indication to undergo CTPA was much higher than the number of patients who underwent the exam in real-life. This might indicate that current recommendations for diagnosing PE overestimate the need for CTPA in the COVID-19 population. Alternatively, it might indicate that physicians do not properly follow the guidelines for the diagnosis of PE when managing COVID-19 patients. In either case, the result is that patients undergo CTPA without an established criterion. Indeed, in our study the subjects who underwent CTPA were not different to those who did not. This point seems to indicate that, regardless the well-established relationship between COVID-19 patients and VTE (12) , clinicians tend to do not request CTPA, even in presence of high pre-test probability of PE. This is probably due to the fact that, in these patients, there is an alternative reason that might explain the acute respiratory failure, i.e., COVID-19 pneumonia. Nonetheless, when these patients undergo CTPA, a diagnosis of PE is anything but rare. Indeed, in our cohort, 10 out of 28 CTPA were positive for PE. Consistent with this concept is the recent evidence that, when consecutive patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19 undergo CTPA at the time of hospital admission, PE is diagnosed in about 1 patient out of 7 CTPA (13). Our study has some limitations, including a retrospective single-center design, a small sample size and low number of patients who underwent CTPA. Also, it should be noted that the algorithms that we used have been validated mainly for patients who are not receiving anticoagulants, while in our study all subjects were already receiving pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. Another potential limitation is the fact that we only analyzed patients hospitalized during two randomly selected period of 2020 and they might not be fully representative of all COVID-19 patients.",
