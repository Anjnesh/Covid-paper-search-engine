This multi-model classification incorporates Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the last layer of VGG16 Convolution network. For synchronization among VGG16 and SVM we have added one more layer of convolution, pool, and dense between VGG16 and SVM. Further, for transformations and discovering the best result, we have used the Radial Basis function. CovXmlc is compared with five existing models using different parameters and metrics. The result shows that our proposed CovXmlc with minimal dataset reached accuracy up to 95% which is significantly higher than the existing ones. Similarly, it also performs better on other metrics such as recall, precision and f-score.",

The typical symptoms of the disease are; headache, fever, cough, fatigue, muscular pain and respiratory distress [2] [3] [4] [5] . The most prominently used test process called Reverse Transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is less accurate, particularly in the early stage of the infection and, also it is a time-consuming procedure [6] . Rapid antigen testing can be done to quickly to correlate any symptoms of COVID-19 by collecting sample from the nose using swab [7] . But antigen testing is considered to be less accurate than RT-PCR. Also, repeated testing is required to confirm the status from time to time. In the due course, the patient has to be quarantined until the result is not processed. Negative RT-PCR using nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swab test does not rule our COVID-19 diagnosis as NP/OP sensitivity in the course of disease lies from 42 % to 71 % [8] .",

The reduced accuracy in early detection of disease in RT-PCR process can be overcome by supplementing radiological chest images such as X-rays and Computed Tomography CT [9] . The radiological images seem promising to detect the disease at the onset, or even before, of any symptoms encountered [10] . Nevertheless, radio imaging and RT-PCR both can be combinedly applied to support more sensitivity for detecting and predicting COVID-19 [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The rapid and more accurate results of radio images persuade researchers to evaluate these images using different deep learning techniques and models. This will help automate a major part of detection process while adding more accuracy. Moreover, these methodologies can be applied to various other tests of infections.",

Currently, many diseases can be detected using the models of deep earning, such disease can be diabetic retinopathy, detection of tumors in different body organs such as breast, head, lungs and brain [20] [21] [22] .

For an unbalanced dataset between COVID and other images, [27] purposes a model based on RestNetV20 and Xception to detect COVID-19 and pneumonia using chest X-rays. For classification [28] DarkNet model is used as the base model with seventeen layers of convolution. It uses an equal number of normal and pneumonia images and uses LeayReLU operations for binary classification. Image augmentation is used to increase the number of infected images [29] , it classifies images into three different categories COVID, normal and pneumonia. It is using 66 COVID X-ray images. A metalerner [30] architecture is introduced to process different shapes of input images. It uses ReLU as an activation function to classify images among normal, bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia. A quick summery is shown in Table 1 .",

VGG16 is trained in large classes of ImageNet dataset. Instead of, starting from the scratch the processed weights from the VGG16 can be used for image classification. However, for detecting COVID-19 cases more robust and dependable models are required. For this, our experiment uses multi-model combinations of these machine learning models. The block diagram of proposed model is depicted in Fig. 1 . The figure shows VGG16 model clubbed with State Vector Machine (SVM) model. In this model instead of depending fully on VGG16, the SVM is also introduced to perform additional processing on the intermediate feature extraction by VGG16. The final output of the model (that is, based on the X-ray image, whether the patient can be diagnosed normal or COVID-19) will be given by the SVM. The VGG16 model is referred in Fig. 3 . The model represents its architecture, the model takes an input of 224*224 RGB images.

The proposed model significantly much higher in terms of recall, it reveals that it is better by 7.2 % on average while having a maximum improvement of 9.4 % at 100 epochs and 5.5 % is at the minimum with 50 epochs. A weighted harmonic mean known as F1-Score is plotted in Fig. 12 . It is most suitable in case of uneven class distributions. The plot reveals that the proposed model outperforms by 3.3 % on an average case. The maximum increase is 4.4 % with 50 epochs while the minimum increase is 2.2 % at 125 epochs.",

The strength of the proposed model is to add SVM on top of the VGG16 model, it significantly improved accuracy to 95 % from 90 %. Our model shows promising results even by utilizing a limited public dataset. Our result shows with the limited number of epochs all the performance parameters were significantly higher than the existing ones, but with a higher number of epochs, our results are marginally better. This is due to the overfitting in the learning phase. So, in the experiment, we can conclude that CovXmlc is performing significantly excellent with lower epochs even using a small dataset. In the current scenario, different variants of COVID-19 are existing. Our research does not take this under consideration, in the future we will try to incorporate the classification using these variants. SVM will also be incorporated and analyze with transfer learning models other than VGG16. Also, our model will be tested with other diseases as well in which radiology images are available as a public dataset.",
