However, in some European countries, certain differences were identified such as in France, the trend of musculoskeletal disorders, mental health and neurological diseases to the disability has changed since 2010 and occupational risks are underestimated by IHME. In Romania, mortality rates for cardiovascular diseases and cancer are under-estimated by IHME as compared to national statistics and premature mortality for cardiovascular diseases are over-estimated by IHME. In Serbia, mortality rates for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were under-estimated by IHME as compared to the Serbian BoD study in 2000. In Scotland, the mortality rates due to substance use have higher numbers in the national death register compared to those used by IHME. Some countries reported additional data sources used by the individual country for national health reporting not enlisted in IHME list. The countries who calculate their own BoD estimates mentioned that choice of a standard population and the use of different methodological choices could influence the estimates.",

This approach highlights the usefulness and possible applications of a standardized, comprehensive methodology in Burden of Disease assessment and allows a standardized comparison with European peer countries. However, most of the European countries do not produce GBD-metrics (YLLs, YLDs, DALYs). Therefore, we intend to compare the ranking of priorities in diseases and risk factors, using GBD metrics (as provided by the Country Health Profile developed using the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation methodology), to the ranking of a country's standard metrics (mortality, morbidity rates, risk factor prevalence, etc.). For example, the national ranking of a given country could be based on risk factor prevalence showing that smoking is its main health problem, whereas GBDmetrics (i.e., DALYs attributable to risk factors) may show that alcohol is more important. No attempt has been made to provide a detailed background narrative to the findings of country health profiles.",

However, by changing the reference population from European Standard Population to the World Standard Population, this ranking changes and cancer mortality rates have become the first contributing factor to the burden of mortality as used by IHME. The estimates calculated by SPMA do not take into account the redistribution of ill-defined codes. In Estonia, the mortality rate for neurological disorders have grown year by year but according to the European standard population the rate for injuries (unintentional and intentional self-harm) are higher than the rate for neurological disorders and there are more respiratory infections than neurological disorders. In Romania, an important difference was observed i.e., the mortality rates for cardiovascular diseases are below 400/100,000 according to IHME estimates but according to national health statistics, these estimates are higher, and slightly decreasing from 725 in 1999 to 677 in 2017, respectively. The mortality rates for cancer are increasing from 173 in 1999 to 233 in 2017 according to national statistics but these mortality rates are less than 200 according to IHME estimates. In Serbia, mortality rates for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were underestimated by IHME as compared to the Serbian BoD study in 2000 due to different methods of estimation. In Scotland, the mortality rates in 2013 and 2016 due to substance use had higher numbers in national death register. The reason for this increase was due to use of an expanded set of ICD codes for drug related deaths. In Spain, the national health statistics reported an increase in mortality rates of respiratory and neurological diseases between 2010 and 2017 whereas according to IHME these mortality rates are decreasing.",

Expected values are based on a country's expected performance according to its Socio-demographic Index (SDI) (computed using the geometric mean of income per person, educational attainment in the population older than age 15 years, and total fertility rate). 1 Please note that GBD does not publish expected life expectancy for the European Union as a whole, which is why figures were used for Western Europe for illustrative purposes. shows morbidity, as Years lived with disability (YLDs). These are years lived in less than ideal health. This includes health loss that may last for only a few days or a lifetime. YLDs are estimated from the prevalence of diseases and injuries, and the corresponding disability weight for each sequela. YLDs adjusted for disability and co-morbidity are the final YLDs. Trends in morbidity often show markedly different patterns from mortality, often 'flatlining' whereas mortality decreases. Figure 5 shows the combined burden of mortality and morbidity, Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). These are the years of healthy life lost due to premature death and disability. DALYs are the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). It is the major metric used in burden of disease assessments. Its shape is usually heavily influenced by the mortality component. Figure 6 shows the DALYs lost to all causes, distributed by most common risk factors. GBD uses a 3-category structure of risks, i.e. behavioural, metabolic and environmental, and estimates single risk factor -health outcome pairs. The amount of DALYs (their PAFs [Population Attributable Fractions]) reflects known risk factors, and therefore represents a fraction of total DALYs, as conditions such as e.g. dementia, musculoskeletal disorders or cancer are only partly explained by underlying risk factors. This allows explaining, which causes have most contributed to changes in burden. A frequent finding across countries is the year-on-year decrease in cardiovascular disease rates. Figure 8 presents values for the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ) 2 . This is a measure of amenable mortality based on GBD mortality rates. It is based on 32 underlying causes of death. The HAQ summarizes amenable mortality (premature deaths theoretically avoidable by access to and receipt of high quality medical care) into an index, which takes values from 0-100 where 100 is best achievable performance. Amenable mortality refers to deaths, which are thought to be avoidable in a defined set of conditions by optimal access to and quality of medical care. The higher the value of the index the more likely people are able to access high quality effective care. It has been used as a comparative measure of healthcare and health system performance for years. The box-and-whiskers plot shows the distribution of HAQ values for Member States, with the individual country highlighted as a red dot. This is the main index used by GBD to measure health system performance.",
