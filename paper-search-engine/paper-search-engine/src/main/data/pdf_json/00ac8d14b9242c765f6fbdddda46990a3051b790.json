As described in the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion ('Ottawa Charter'), settings are the places where people \"learn, work, play and love\" [1] . Settings-based health promotion recognizes that environmental, economic, political, social and cultural determinants shape health and illness [2] and that it is necessary to look beyond individual factors alone when striving to generate and maintain wellbeing. While health promotion initiatives have taken place in schools, workplaces, prisons and towns, there has been recent interest in organized sport as a setting within which health becomes an innate part of culture, structures, processes and routine operations [3] [4] [5] .",

Throughout this process, it is the organizational system and structures and groups within it that are the primary targets of change, rather than individuals [44, 45] .

Another characteristic, 'mode', includes the depth within the organization at which the change occurs, such as changes to observable artefacts or more fundamental transformations to organizational culture [48] . 'Level' refers to whether change occurs within or across organizations [49] . Finally, duration is the time over which change takes place [44] .

Of these, five clubs provided consent and engaged in the initial action planning process, described below. Recruitment of clubs from the same geographic region occurred at the request of Gymnastics NSW, to facilitate delivery of the health promotion program in line with the Development Department's existing model of support to clubs. Three of the five clubs were privately-owned businesses and offered gymnastics programs only (hereafter GOC, gymnastics-only club). The remaining two, one a council-operated leisure center and one a Police Citizens Youth Club (PCYC), were multi-sport centers (hereafter MSC), offering activities such as fitness classes, swimming, boxing and weights training in addition to gymnastics. These clubs varied based on: the number of registered gymnasts; physical characteristics; gymnastics programs offered; number of staff, coaches and volunteers; communication channels used; and existing partnerships with external organizations ( Table 1) . Each of the clubs had at least 100 registered gymnasts at the time of the study, with the largest club being GOCc, which had at least 300 members. The two MSCs had a manager who oversaw the entire center, additional administrative staff and approximately 10 coaches employed on a casual basis. In contrast, the GOCs had at most two staff members responsible for administrative matters, and these staff were also heavily involved with coaching. Examining gymnastics clubs with varied contextual backgrounds provided the opportunity to analyze diverse experiences of the HPGC program, described below, thus demonstrating similarities and differences in contexts and processes [77, 78] .",

This reflects findings of previous HPSC studies, such as conducted by Casey, Payne and Eime [57] and Olstad, Raine and McCargar [60] , which reported organizations with smaller capacity face greater challenges when implementing sports-based health promotion innovations. This could be indicative of the need for increased support from multiple levels of sport and other sectors to ensure health promotion becomes an integral part of the core business of sport. Adequate capacity of community sports organizations to introduce and sustain changes depends on the number and nature (paid or volunteer) of staff and the agency of the organization to introduce changes to operations and the physical environment [93] .",

Organizational leaders contribute significantly to the creation of organizational culture [52, 94] , exemplified in this study through their role as a gatekeeper to introducing innovations such as the HPGC program. The leader's attitudes and perceptions of organizational priorities (e.g., business and competitions) considerably hindered any or timely implementation of health promotion activities and were barriers to the subsequent continuation, improvement or increase in health promotion activities in these settings. The findings that long-standing organizational cultures and ways of operating prove difficult to change, even when stakeholders' perceptions may reportedly align with the values and potential positive outcomes of such an initiative, were consistent with those of previous studies [52, 94] . Future studies need to incorporate comprehensive understanding of the cultures of participating organizations in order to maximize the impact and outcomes of organizational change.",

It is not possible to assume all gymnastics clubs mirror the contextual molds of those involved in this study nor that they experience similar outcomes. However, principles of the study framework can enhance the appropriateness and relevance of health promotion initiatives to each unique club in the future. There was minimal stakeholder participation during post-intervention data collection processes within each organization, despite the study inviting the inclusion of multiple respondents from each organization. Notably, for clubs, this was characterized by the single perspective of the person considered most responsible for the whole club (e.g., owner and manager), and their innate perspectives will have shaped the data collected. The fact that organizational gatekeepers did not invite another representative from their club to participate in the post-intervention data collection may suggest a certain perspective on organizational change, the control they exerted over the club and the ingrained nature of communication and decision making in the club. Future research should endeavor to include the voices of multiple stakeholders with different roles from each organization (e.g., manager, parent, coach and gymnast) to minimize the potential biases of single respondents and to maximize the breadth of data collected.",

While Australian gymnastics clubs, like all sport, experienced a short period of closure, clubs reopened within 6-9 months and were subject to government regulatory requirements to control the spread of infection (e.g., cleaning procedures and reduced class sizes). However, the potential for gymnastics (sport) clubs to be health-promoting settings is likely to remain as relevant at the time of publication as when the data were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be due, in part, to the presence of enduring organizational culture that often inhibits organizational change.",

Guided by organizational change theory, the study contributes to the body of evidence that identifies sports settings as positioned to create environments that promote health and wellbeing beyond participation in physical activity. The findings highlight the importance of embedding organizational change theory within similar initiatives, paying particular attention to the culture of participating organizations and key facilitators and barriers of the organizational change process. Despite some positive impacts, organizational culture (private enterprise and competition) inhibited adoption of health promotion as a core value in participating organizations. Sustained organizational change may result from professional regulatory requirements (e.g., accreditation and affiliation), policy direction and funding (for organizational change, not program delivery) from relevant government departments. To engender a cultural shift in sport such that it integrates health promotion within its core business, it will be important to take sustained action through participatory and whole-of-system approaches, draw on intersectoral partnerships and be responsive to the unique contexts of different sports organizations.",
