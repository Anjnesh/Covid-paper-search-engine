            "text": "We have discovered a family of synthetic oxazole-based macrocycles to be active against SARS-CoV-2. The synthesis, pharmacological properties, and docking studies of the compounds are reported in this study. The structure of the new macrocycles was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Compounds 13, 14, and 15a-c were evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity on SARS-COV-2 (NRC-03-nhCoV) virus in Vero-E6 cells. Isopropyl triester 13 and triacid 14 demonstrated superior inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV-2 compared to carboxamides 15a-c. MTT cytotoxicity assays showed that the CC 50 (50% cytotoxicity concentration) of 13, 14, and 15a-c ranged from 159.1 to 741.8 \u03bcM and their safety indices ranged from 2.50 to 39.1. Study of the viral inhibition via different mechanisms of action (viral adsorption, replication, or virucidal property) showed that 14 had mild virucidal (60%) and inhibitory effects on virus adsorption (66%) at 20 \uf06dM concentrations. Compound 13 displayed several inhibitory effects at three levels, but the potency of its action is primarily virucidal. The inhibitory activity of compounds 13, 14, and 15a-c against the enzyme SARS-CoV-2 M pro was evaluated. Isopropyl triester 13 had a significant inhibition activity against SARS-CoV-2 M pro with an IC 50 of 2.58 \u00b5M. Large substituents on the macrocyclic template significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of the compounds. Study of the docking of the compounds in the SARS CoV-2-M pro active site showed that the most potent macrocycles 13 and 14 exhibited the best fit and highest affinity for the active site binding pocket. Taken together, the present study shows that the new macrocyclic compounds constitute a new family of SARS CoV-2-M pro inhibitors that are worth being further optimized and developed.",

The new virus has now infected over 120 million people around the world and resulted in over 2.6 million deaths [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, belongs to the genus Beta coronavirus and is responsible for the infection of the lower respiratory tract in particular, resulting in the disease COVID-19 [1, 6] . SARS-CoV-2 is a 30,000-base pair single stranded RNA virus, which possesses an envelope containing spike (S) proteins on its surface which binds with high affinity to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) embedded in the membrane of cells found in the lungs, heart, kidneys, intestines, and arteries. This results in the infection of these cells by the virus [1, 7] . The incubation time can vary from 2 days up to 24 days and is asymptomatic in many cases, which facilitated the virus transmission [6] . Several efficient and safe vaccines have rapidly been developed by several pharmaceutical companies [7] . The production of sufficient doses for the vaccination of the world population has proved challenging with the concomitant threat of the emergence of vaccine-resistant variants of the virus.",

COVID-19-related research has been able to elucidate many druggable SARS-CoV-2 targets, including the spike (S) protein, the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease/main protease (3CL pro /M pro ), the papain-like protease (PL pro ), and the RNA-dependent polymerase [3, 7] . Of these, viral proteases PL pro and M pro constitute the most promising targets for the development of effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Viral proteases in coronaviruses are responsible for the development of non-structural proteins (nsps) by processing viral RNA translated polyproteins [3] [4] 7] . Thus, M pro and PL pro have acknowledged a great deal of publicity for their significant role in the enzymatic operation leading to their post-translational treatment of replicate polyproteins that are essential to the life cycle of the corona virus [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

On the other hand, more than 40 cyclic peptides are used clinically in treatment of different diseases [22] . These peptides came from natural and synthetic origin. Takagi et al. have reported a series of cyclic peptide as NS2B-NS3 protease inhibitor [23] . The design of these peptides was done to mimic the substrate of NS2B-NS3 protease. Among this series, the cyclic peptide X (Fig. 2 ) exhibited inhibitory activity of NS2B-NS3 protease of dengue virus at IC 50 of 0.95 \u03bcM. Aspergilli peptide D XI is a natural product isolated from Aspergillus sp and exhibited inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 at IC 50 value of 9.5 \u03bcM [24] . The eight-residue cyclic D,L-\u03b1-peptide XII exhibited antiviral activity against adenovirus infection without an apparent adverse effect on cell viability [25] . The plausible mechanism of action of this compound could be mediated by targeting endosomal compartments in pHdependent viral infections. Liang et al. have reported a series of cyclic peptide XIII with significant antifungal and obvious antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus [26] .

Molecular docking studyGiven the promising activity of new macrocyclic compounds 13, 14, and 15a-c against COVID-19, we conducted a molecular docking study to investigate possible binding patterns and interactions of the compounds in the active site of COVID-19 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 M pro ). The 3dimentional crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro (PDB ID: 6LU7) in complex with covalent inhibitor N3, was downloaded from the protein data bank (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6LU7) and the docking simulation process was accomplished using AutoDock Vina[41] as docking module embedded in AutoDockTools (ADT)[42,43]. Ligands and protein files were prepared using Discovery Studio Visualizer[44], AutoDockTools, and docked to SARS-CoV-2 M pro (PDB ID:6LU7) with AutoDock Vina. Validation of the docking was performed using the recently reported X-ray structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro in complex with non-covalent inhibitor Mcule-5948770040 (PDB ID: 7LTJ) [45]. Examination of the crystal structure indicated that Mcule-5948770040 binding position is probably not significantly influenced by bridging water molecules, contrary to some other noncovalent inhibitors. The shapes of the binding sites in 6LU7 and 7LTJ are highly identical and structure 7LTJ was deemed appropriate for performing the docking validation as Mcule-5948770040 is non-covalent inhibitor. Remarkably in this case, the highest scoring pose (-9.4 kcal/mol) for the re-docking of Mcule-5948770040 was found to have an almost identical binding position and conformation to that of the ligand in the crystal structure (RMDS of 0.1325 \u00c5) [Fig. 5]. This validated the use of Autodock Vina in the present docking study assuming that there are no major water-mediated interactions between the enzyme and the macrocyclic compounds.",

However, there are no protruding groups in this case to fill the N3 benzyl group binding site. Nevertheless, the binding energy obtained by AutoDock Vina for the triacid 14 (-7.9 kcal/mol) was found to be comparable to that obtained for the triester 13 (-7.5 kcal/mol).Triamide 15a was also found to adopt a similar position as triester 13 and triacid 14 in the binding site, with essentially similar interactions with the platform. Additional interactions can also be seen, including an excellent size and shape complementarity of the V3 benzyl group binding site with one of the phenethyl groups of 15a, interacting with His-41, Leu-27 and Cys-145. The other phenethyl groups, however, cannot adopt low-energy extended conformations and this would cause a significant decrease in binding affinity.

Collectively, the docking study, along with in vitro SARS-CoV-2 M pro results, seem to indicate that the active site of the protease can accommodate large molecules. The docking study suggests that derivatives of triester 13, which feature elements of triacid 14 and triamide 15a, as well as modifications of the tris(oxazole) platform using appropriate substituents could lead to highly active SARS-CoV-2 M pro inhibitors. CONCLUSION A small set of new oxazole-based macrocycles 13, 14, and 15a-c synthesized, and tested for their anti-SARS-COV-2 activity. Compounds 13, 14 and 15a showed promising inhibitory properties for the SARS-COV-2 (NRC-03-nhCoV) virus in Vero-E6 cells, and the SARS-CoV-2 main protease assay revealed significant inhibitory effects of these compounds. This mechanism of action is further supported by docking experiments which have shown that most of the tested compounds fit well within the SARS CoV-2-M pro active pocket. The results of the docking study are consistent with the in vitro SARS CoV-2-M pro inhibitory activities of the compounds. Taken together, these oxazole-based macrocyclic compounds could constitute promising leads for further optimization and development against SARS-CoV main proteases, and open new avenues to help defeat future infections by coronavirus variants.",
