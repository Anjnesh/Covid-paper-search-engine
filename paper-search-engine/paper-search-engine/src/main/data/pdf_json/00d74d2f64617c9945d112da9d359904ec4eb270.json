            "text": "This paper deals with the spread of diseases over both a population network and an infrastructure network. We develop a layered networked spread model for a susceptibleinfected-susceptible (SIS) pathogen-borne disease spreading over a human contact network and an infrastructure network, and refer to it as a layered networked susceptible-infected-watersusceptible (SIWS) model. The \"W\" in SIWS represents any infrastructure network contamination, not necessarily restricted to a water distribution network. We say that the SIWS network is in the healthy state (also referred to as the diseasefree equilibrium) if none of the individuals in the population are infected nor is the infrastructure network contaminated; otherwise, we say that the network is in the endemic state (also referred to as the endemic equilibrium). First, we establish sufficient conditions for local exponential stability and global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the healthy state. Second, we provide sufficient conditions for existence, uniqueness, and GAS of the endemic state. Building off of these results, we provide a necessary, and sufficient, condition for the healthy state to be the unique equilibrium of our model. Third, we show that the endemic equilibrium of the SIWS model is worse than that of the networked SIS model without any infrastructure network, in the sense that at least one subpopulation has strictly larger infection proportion at the endemic equilibrium in the former model than that in the latter. Fourth, we study an observability problem, and, assuming that the measurements of the sickness-levels of the human contact network are available, provide a necessary and sufficient condition for estimation of the pathogen levels in the infrastructure network. Furthermore, we provide another sufficient, but not necessary, condition for estimation of pathogen levels in the infrastructure network. By leveraging the sufficient condition we finally provide insights in to how the measurement matrix could be designed so that the system is locally weakly observable.",

The devastation that epidemics can bring worldwide, both from loss of life, and, less importantly, from hindrance to economic activity, has been brought into stark relief by the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. Consequently, understanding the causes of spread of diseases, and, as a result, possibly mitigating (or eradicating) the spread have been questions of longstanding interest for the scientific community. The earliest work in this area can be traced back to [1] . In recent times, modeling and analysis of spreading processes has attracted the attention of researchers across a wide spectrum ranging from mathematical epidemiology [1, 2] and physics [3] to the social sciences [4] .",

An overview of these models is provided in [5] , and [6] , respectively. The present paper relies on the SIS model, which was first introduced in [7] . In an SIS model, an agent (resp. node), which can be interpreted as either an individual or, equivalently, a community, is either in the infected state or in the susceptible state. Assuming there is a non-trivial disease-spread in a population, an agent that is in the susceptible state, as a consequence of interactions with its neighbors, and depending on its infection rate, transitions to the infected state; an agent that is in the infected state recovers from the infections based on its healing rate.",

However, [3, 8, 9, 12, 13] only account for time-invariant interconnections among the agents. Overcoming this drawback, SIS networked models with time-varying topologies have been developed and analysed in [14] - [16] . Nonetheless, the bulk of the existing literature on SIS models factors in only person-toperson interaction. However, diseases can spread also through other medium, such as water [17] (or infected surfaces, e.g., in hospitals [18] , public transit vehicles [19] , etc). Water-borne pathogens could spread through infrastructure networks, water distribution systems (e.g., rivers, groundwater, and reservoirs) [20] . Moreover, while water quality issues are very prevalent in developing countries with less advanced plumbing and sewage infrastructure, such issues occasionally affect more prosperous countries as well. Notably, Sweden has had a number of water contamination incidents which have affected thousands of residents. For example, in\u00d6stersund in Northern Sweden, approximately 27, 000 people (\u223c45% of the population) became ill and had a water-boil order for over two months as the result of Cryptosporidium contamination of the drinking water [21] . Hence, there is a need for SIS networked models that also account for the spread of diseases through water distribution networks.",

More recently, a variant of the SIS model called the Susceptible-Infected-Water-Susceptible (SIWS) model has been recently developed in [25] , and a multi-virus single resource SIWS model in [26] . The paper [25] provides sufficient conditions for GAS of the healthy state (see [25, Theorem 1] ), but it does not provide any theoretical guarantees regarding endemic behavior. More recently, sufficient conditions for GAS of the healthy state, and also for the existence, uniqueness, and GAS of the endemic state have been provided in [26] ; see [26, Theorem 2] , and [26, Theorem 3] , respectively. However, both [25] and [26] consider only the presence of a single resource. Notice that if there are multiple water resources being accessed by the population, then the spread of virus could be due to not only node-to-node interaction and node-to-resource interactions, but also due to resource-to-resource interaction. The present paper aims to develop such a model (called the layered networked SIWS model), and provide an in-depth analysis of its various equilibria viz. existence, uniqueness, and stability. Based on the aforementioned analysis, we would also focus on understanding the effect on the endemic level of the population nodes in the presence of shared resource(s) as compared to the absence of the same.",

In particular, for largescale infrastructure networks (as is the case with modern societies), it is not economically viable to install sensors everywhere. However, by employing system-theoretic notions such as observability 1 , one could address the aforementioned challenge by deploying as few sensors as possible. One of the earliest works in this direction is [27] , where the problem of which subset of nodes in a network should be measured so as to improve observability of a SIS network is addressed; the condition therein involves checking the determinant of the inverse of the observability Grammian. Inspired by the work in [27] , we aim to address the following question: under what conditions can we estimate the contamination levels in the infrastructure network by only measuring the infection levels of individuals in the population? Furthermore, given knowledge of such conditions, can we glean any insights into how the measurement matrix might be designed so that the contamination levels in the infrastructure network can be recovered purely by measuring the infection levels of individuals in the population? The key theoretical tool that we would be using to answer these questions is the notion of local weak observability of non-linear systems 2 .",

We have analyzed the stability of the healthy state, both locally and globally. We compared the basic reproduction number of the model with the standard networked SIS model without a pathogen. We have established conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and stability of an endemic equilibrium. We have also provided a necessary and sufficient condition for the healthy state to be the only equilibrium of this model.

Due to \u03a8 0 and the Rayleigh-Ritz Theorem [37, Theorem 4.2.2], it follows from (41) that r = 0, and thatz spans the eigenspace of r. Hence, due toz 0, and z(t) > 0 with z i (t) = 0 for some i \u2208 [n + m], z(t) can not be parallel toz. Consequently, \u2206z(t) can not be parallel toz. By the Rayleigh-Ritz Theorem [37, Theorem 4.2.2], x T \u03a8x = rx T x only if x is parallel toz, and x T \u03a8x < rx T x otherwise. Therefore, r = 0 together with (40) gives usV (\u2206z(t)) < 0 for all z(t) \u2208 D \\ {0} such that z(t) 0 and z(t) \u2212z = 0. Thus, we haveV (\u2206z(t)) < 0 for all z(t) \u2208 D\\{0} such that \u2206z(t) = z(t)\u2212z = 0, and it is clear thatV (0) = 0. Therefore, V (\u2206y(t)) \u227a 0 for y(t) \u2208 D \\ {0}. Finally, for reasons similar to that in [26, Lemma 7] , we have that D \\ {0} is a positively invariant set with respect to (9) . Thus, we see that V (\u2206z(t)) meets the conditions for [38, Theorem 4.1] with respect to the shifted coordinates \u2206z(t) = z(t) \u2212z, for all z(t) \u2208 D \\ {0}.

            "text": "We will now prove that the endemic equilibrium is unique. Suppose that there are two endemic equilibria,z andz. Note that, by similar arguments as in [26, Lemma 6],z 0 andz 0. Let \u03ba = max i\u2208[n+m]zi /z i . It turns out that \u03ba is given byTo see this, assume by way of contradiction that \u03ba = z n+j /z n+j for some j \u2208 [m], and thus \u03ba >z i /z i , for all i \u2208 [n]. Since bothz andz are equilibria of system (9) , it follows that, for each j \u2208 [m]Since we have that \u03ba >z i /z i , for all i \u2208 [n], then \u03baz i >z i , for all i \u2208 [n]. Since by assumption \u03ba =z n+j /z n+j for some j \u2208 [m], it follows that, for each k \u2208 [m],z n+k \u2264 \u03baz n+k . Then, (29) yieldsHence, for all j \u2208 [m], \u03ba >z n+j /z n+j , which contradicts the assumption that \u03ba =z n+j /z n+j , for some j \u2208 [m]. Therefore, \u03ba must be given by (28) . Now, by (28) we know thatz \u2264 \u03baz. For some j \u2208 [n] we havez j = \u03baz j . Assume, by way of contradiction, that \u03ba > 1. Then, since an equilibrium of (9) also constitutes a fixed point of T (z), we hav\u1ebdwhere (30) follows fromz \u2264 \u03baz and that T (v) \u2265 T (w) whenever v \u2265 w, (31) follows from the assumption \u03ba > 1, and (32) follows from the fact thatz is an equilibrium of (9). Note that (33) is a contradiction, following from our assumption that \u03ba > 1. Hence, \u03ba \u2264 1, meaning thatz \u2264z. Switching the roles ofz andz, we see thatz \u2264z. Therefore, z =z, and thus the equilibrium is unique.Part 3: Proof of asymptotic convergence Let \u2206z(t) = z(t) \u2212z, for z(t) \u2208 D. Also let, X(\u2206z(t)) = X(z(t)) \u2212 X(z). Therefore, it follows that:where (34) is obtained by noting that sincez is the unique endemic equilibrium of system (9) in D,Equation (35) follows by noting that, for any two vectors u and v, X(u)v = X(v)u. By Assumption 2, it is immediate that D and D w are positive diagonal matrices. Since diag (A w ) = \u2212 k \u03b1 kj , it follows that \u2212 diag (A w ) = k \u03b1 kj . Hence Assumption 2 also ensures that \u2212 diag (A w ) is nonnegative, and as a consequence, D w \u2212 diag (A w ) is a positive diagonal matrix. Therefore, D f is a positive diagonal matrix, and, hence, is invertible. Consequently, (36) can be rewritten as:",
