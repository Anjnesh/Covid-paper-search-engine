Biofilms are matrix-enclosed communities and enable bacteria to resist host defenses and antibiotics [1, 2] , and thus bacteria in biofilms can endure for extended periods and are difficult to eradicate in hospital settings [1] . Acinetobacter baumannii was ranked by the World Health Organization as a highest priority critical pathogen in 2017 and the most successful multidrug-resistant ESKAPE organism (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, A. baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter organisms) [3] [4] [5] . Moreover, A. baumannii causes a wide range of infections, including pneumonia, bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, and severe nosocomial wound infections, urinary tract infections, bloodstream, skin, and other soft tissue infections [6] [7] [8] . Because A. baumannii possesses an array of acquired antibiotics resistance mechanisms, and as its natural habitat has not been well-defined, the treatment of its infections is challenging. Moreover, 5% to 10% of A. baumannii infections are hospital-acquired infections [4, 6] .",

Furthermore, the expression of usherchaperone assembly for pili production is responsible for motility and cell attachment and is required for successful biofilm development [10, 11] . These virulence determinants help A. baumannii to adhere to eukaryotic cells and abiotic surfaces and promote invasion conjugated linoleic acid (C18:2), linolenic acid (C18:3), arachidonic acid (C20:4), erucic acid (C22:1), tricosanoic acid (C23:0), and nervonic acid (C24:1) ( Figure 1A )-and crystal violet were purchased from either Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI, USA), or TCI Co. (Tokyo, Japan). A. baumannii ATCC 17978 was acquired from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and two other clinical isolates of A. baumannii (ATCC BAA 1709 and A 550) [33] , isolated from burn patients at the National Rehabilitation Institute of Mexico, were obtained as a gift from Prof. Garcia Contreras Rodolfo, UNAM, Mexico. For all experiments, A. baumannii strains were cultured under aerobic conditions at 37 \u2022 C in tryptic soy broth (TSB; Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA). Fatty acids were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). DMSO (0.1% (v/v)) was used as the negative control; at this concentration, it did not affect bacterial growth or biofilm formation.",

Furthermore, the CASTp server-predicted active binding site of AbaI was made into a grid for the re-confirmation of the active binding pocket of protein by the VINA random method, with 25 runs between the ligand and AbaI. Later, the predicted active site was assigned for a final grid by molecular screening by treating drug molecules as rigid entities and the receptor as a flexible entity [44, 45] . To ensure the reliability, validity, and reproducibility of docking results, molecular docking was performed using AUTODOCK [46] and VINA [47] . Binding energies and interactions between nervonic, oleic, or myristoleic acid and AbaI were determined using a computational approach, as previously described [46] . Further, a comparative molecular docking study was employed using SAM (natural ligand to AbaI) (positive control) and two non-active fatty acids, linolenic acid or tricosanoic acid, with the same assigned active site of AbaI protein to confirm the conformation binding of these molecules.

            "text": "Fatty acids are ubiquitous amphiphilic molecules with a long carbon chain and terminal carboxyl group and are considered prospective contenders for use against recalcitrant pathogens [20] . Here, we report the biofilm inhibitory capacities of a series of fatty acids against the clinically relevant biofilm-forming bacterial pathogen A. baumannii. Among the tested 24 fatty acids, nervonic and oleic acid most efficiently reduced in vitro biofilm formation by three A. baumannii strains ( Figure 1A-D) . Nicole et al. (2018) reported that myristoleic acid at 20 \u00b5g/mL inhibited A. baumannii biofilm formation by 28% [32] , while we found that myristoleic acid inhibited biofilm formation by 7% at the same concentration. Furthermore, myristoleic and palmitoleic acid impeded the motility of A. baumannii [32] , which is interesting as pili play a role in biofilm formation and motility. In our study, motility was significantly reduced by nervonic acid as compared to oleic or myristoleic acid ( Figure 2B) . A. baumannii biofilm formation and motility depend on the synthesis of pili and are associated with type IV pili [10, 11] , which are structures assembled by CsuA/BABCDE, the pilus usher-chaperone secretion system under the control of A1S_2811 [57] , and the AbaI-dependent quorum sensing pathway [57] [58] [59] . Thus, these comparative observations of the biofilm and motility inhibition of A. baumannii suggested that nervonic and oleic are leading molecules for further investigation. In addition, to reveal the plausible molecular mechanism of these fatty acids with AbaI protein, molecular docking was carried out, and we found that these fatty acids bind with AbaI via common amino acids Leu31, Pro149, Ile172, Tyr175, and Met177, indicating that these essential amino acids are the key residues for binding with the active pocket domain of AbaI. As a previous report suggests that SAM and acyl-acyl carrier protein substrates are essential for the synthesis of the auto-inducers (AHLs) [18] , inspired by the significant role of SAM, we proposed that similar binding ligands to SAM with AbaI might work as a barrier for the synthesis of AHLs, leading to the inhibition of biofilm formation and virulence. In this regard, we searched for ligands which have the same binding conformation with AbaI, and the outcomes of the conformational binding of SAM with AbaI and their amino acid residues were similar to those of our tested binding of SAM with AbaI (Table 1) , confirming the same conformational binding of nervonic and oleic acid to AbaI [60] . Among the bound amino acid residue of nervonic acid, four amino acid residues (Leu31, Pro149, Tyr175, and Met177) matched with those of SAM, and three amino acid residues (Ile172, Tyr175, and Met177) of oleic acid docking matched with SAM. Thus, similar to SAM, the binding conformation of nervonic and oleic acid with AbaI suggest that these fatty acids are possible lead molecules to design a potent AbaI inhibitor against A. baumannii. Further, the stabilities of complexes of these fatty acids with AbaI in MD simulation supported our hypothesis that nervonic acid specifically has better conformational stability and strongly binds with AbaI protein compared to oleic or myristoleic acid, along with presenting a similar initial and final position throughout MD runs ( Figure 5 ). Hence, it can be suggested that the nervonic or oleic acid-AbaI complex might hamper the production of AHL molecules, disrupt the quorum sensing cascade, and render A. baumannii in the planktonic cell stage.",

In this regard, we addressed the screening of fatty acids against the biofilm of A. baumannii using in silico and in vitro approaches, which collectively suggested that nervonic and oleic acid act as suppressors of AbaI protein in A. baumannii and of biofilm formation without killing bacteria or C. elegans. The remarkable conformational stability of nervonic and oleic acid with AbaI protein helped us to understand the molecular mechanism of the biofilm inhibition of A. baumannii via AbaI deactivation. Additionally, the in vivo safety profiles and in vitro antibiofilm potencies of nervonic and oleic acid suggested that these molecules might be considered to treat persistent infections either singly or in combination as adjunctive treatments. This binding of fatty acids to AHL synthase through molecular simulation studies will help researchers to design or find new biomolecules targeting the QS network. ",
