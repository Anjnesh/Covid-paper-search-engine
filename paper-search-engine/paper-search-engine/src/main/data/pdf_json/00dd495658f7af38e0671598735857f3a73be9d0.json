            "text": "the underlying mechanisms. Ninety-six male ICR (6 weeks old) mice were randomly divided into three groups: Sham, LPS, and LPS + MSC groups. The mice were intratracheally injected with 5 mg/kg LPS to induce acute lung injury (ALI). The histopathological severity of injury to the lung, liver, kidney, heart, and aortic tissues was detected. Wet/dry ratio, protein concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), BALF cell counts, inflammatory cytokine levels in serum, inflammatory cytokine gene expression, and oxidative stress-related indicators were detected. In addition, a survival analysis was performed in sixty male ICR mice (6 weeks old, 18-20 g). This study used chicken BM-MSCs, which are easier to obtain and more convenient than other animal or human MSCs, and have MSC-associated properties, such as a colony forming ability, multilineage differentiation potential, and certain phenotypes. BM-MSCs administration significantly improved the survival rate, systemic inflammation, and the histopathological severity of lung, liver, kidney, and aortic injury during ALI. BM-MSCs administration reduced the levels of inflammatory factors in BALF, the infiltration of neutrophils, and oxidative stress injury in lung tissue. In addition, BM-MSCs administration reduced TRL4 and Mdy88 mRNA expression during ALI. Chicken BM-MSCs serve as a potential alternative resource for stem cell therapy and exert a prominent effect on LPS-induced ALI and extrapulmonary injury, in part through TRL4/Mdy88 signaling and inhibition of neutrophil inflammation and oxidative stress injury.",

ALI is characterized by an uncontrolled inflammatory response involving inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, and effector cells, among which neutrophils play a key role 6,7 . Neutrophils release multiple factors, such as profibrogenic factors matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) 8-11 . Hence, ALI may be accompanied by pulmonary fibrosis. Deleterious activation of neutrophils led to collateral tissue damage 12 . Therefore, ALI may be accompanied by extrapulmonary injuries, such as liver, kidney, heart, and aortic injury. Previous studies have demonstrated that ALI causes acute organ dysfunction, including dysfunction of the cardiovascular system 13 , which delivers oxygen, nutrients, inflammatory cells, and inflammatory cytokines to tissues and seriously impairs organ function, but previous studies have ignored the effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the cardiovascular system in ALI models. Previous researches reported that the inflammatory activation of the human artery endothelial cells required Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to induce the pro-inflammation factors, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 14,15 . Activation of TLR4/myeloid differentiation factor (88MyD88) signaling has been confirmed to lead to a variety of diseases, including ALI 16 . In mice with ALI, LPS OPEN 1 led to an excessive inflammatory response via TLR4/MyD88 signaling, but the effects of BM-MSCs on TLR4/ MyD88 signaling are unclear.",

The main source of flu vaccine ingredients used by people is chickens. Human proteins can be used to produce antibodies to fight diseases, but the cost is high, and the process is complicated. Eggs are very cheap and suitable for mass production. Unlike other species, such as sheep or hamsters, chickens produce protein in a surprisingly similar way to humans. So-called genetically modified chickens can be obtained by implanting genes from other species, including human genes, into the body of chickens. Chicken BM-MSCs offer multiple applicative advantages. MSCs can easily be isolated, cultured, and propagated in vitro. Compared with embryonic stem cells (ESCs), MSCs have a limited risk of tumor formation and do not pose an ethical controversy 21 . However, the vast majority of studies on MSCs mainly concentrate on cells from humans, mice, and rats, but numerous sources for producing these MSCs are not available, and the MSCs cannot be harvested at a low cost. Compared with the species mentioned above, chicken embryos are widely available and are generally the cheapest choice at present. More importantly, the time needed for egg incubation is only 21 days; hence, tissues can be conveniently collected at specific stages of development. The timing of sampling exerts a substantial effect on the activity and proliferative capacity of MSCs 22 . Generally, if the timing of sampling is too early, tissues are not yet formed; if the timing of sampling is too late, the viability of the MSCs is significantly decreased. Hence, this study could reduce the cost of MSC research and contribute to further studies and the application of MSCs. We attempted to provide a scientific foundation for the use of chicken BM-MSCs and to identify whether BM-MSCs can reduce ALI and extrapulmonary injury.",

Next, we characterized BM-MSCs by evaluating their colony-forming and multidirectional differentiation capabilities and the levels of specific surface markers. Finally, we explored whether BM-MSCs administration exerts a positive protective effect against LPS-induced ALI, and potential mechanisms, including inflammation and oxidative stress, were studied. Using bone marrow tissues obtained from 12-day-old chicken embryos, we separated and characterized a novel subset of MSCs, termed BM-MSCs, which showed unique mesenchymal stem cell-like properties. These plastic-adherent cells exhibited a spindle-like morphology similar to fibroblasts and possessed potent self-renewal www.nature.com/scientificreports/ potential. BM-MSCs derived from the embryonic mesoderm were induced to differentiate not only into cells that have an endoderm origin, such as adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes but also into cells with an ectodermal origin, such as neuroblasts, confirming that BM-MSCs have cross-embryonic layer differentiation potential and further supporting their stem cell-like properties. The directional differentiation of the BM-MSCs was determined by the presence of different stimuli. LPS administration leads to an excessive inflammatory response, pulmonary edema, and infiltration of inflammatory cells, which are the three main features of ALI 23, 24 . Treatment with BM-MSCs improved the LPS-induced excessive inflammatory response, pulmonary edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Based on these results, BM-MSCs are a potential treatment for LPS-induced ALI.",

Activation of TLR4/MyD88 signaling was a vital component in the development of ALI 36 . TLR4 was known as an important sensory receptor for LPS. The enhancement of TLR4 signaling pathway led to www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the up-regulation of inflammatory response 37 . Disruption of the TLR4 inhibited lung inflammatory response, confirming the role of TLR receptor signaling in inflammation-associated diseases 38, 39 . TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway enhanced the expression of inflammatory cytokine including IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, which resulted in the inflammatory response aggravation. Blocking the expression of TLR4/NF-\u03baB signal resulted in decreased inflammatory response 40, 41 . Our data demonstrated that LPS administration prominently upregulated TRL4, Mdy88, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA in lung tissue. GMSCs administration prominently downregulated TRL4, Mdy88, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression during ALI. Similarly, GMSCs administration prominently downregulated BALF levels of TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 during ALI. Hence, GMSCs administration impaired LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 release via inhibiting TRL4/Mdy88 expression. In addition, neutrophil accumulation in the lung, which was a characteristic feature of ALI, was attenuated in TLR4 mutant mice, indicating the involvement of TLR4 signaling in neutrophil inflammation in the lung 42, 43 . Excessive neutrophil inflammation was a crucial component of the pathogenesis of ALI. Our data found that LPS administration led to deleterious accumulation of neutrophils in the lung 44, 45 . Deleterious accumulation of neutrophils in the lung was prominently reduced after BM-MSCs administration. Hence, GMSCs may reduce LPS-induced neutrophil infiltration in the lung via suppressing TLR4/Myd88 signaling. The oxidant/antioxidant balance was a vital component in the pathogenesis of ALI and that LPS administration led to oxidative stress injury 46 . In the present study, we found that BM-MSCs had an antioxidant effect.

Previous studies have mainly focused on single factors and single pathways. The idea that one or two pathways exert a decisive role in ALI was not comprehensive and may explain why traditional methods for treating ALI are ineffective. However, MSC administration exerted a positive effect on ALI through multiple mechanisms simultaneously, including inhibition of an excessive inflammatory response and oxidative stress injury. In addition, BM-MSCs administration decreased vascular injury and lung edema. All of these factors combined improved the survival rate of ALI mice. Overall, chicken BM-MSCs serve as a potential alternative resource for stem cell therapy and exert a prominent effect on organ injury including lung, liver, kidney, heart, and aortic injury. BM-MSCs administration increased the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities during ALI. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ BM-MSCs reduced the excessive and uncontrolled inflammatory response involving inflammatory mediators and effector cells, among which neutrophils play a key role. BM-MSCs reduced the neutrophil content, in part because BM-MSCs inhibited the expression of CXCL-1, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1. BM-MSCs altered the levels of inflammatory mediators, partially through inhibition of TLR4/Myd88 signaling.",

Hence mice were intraperitoneally injected with the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine for one week before the experiment.

Our data did not detect the expression levels of HLA responsive to LPS administration.",

MSCs play a prominent role in both restoration of ALI and in protecting vascular injury and restoring endothelial barrier function. Generally, vascular injury occurs before the onset of pulmonary edema and inflammatory infiltration. Our data demonstrated that BM-MSCs protected against aortic injury. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the preventive effect of MSCs in ALI-associated aortic injury have not yet been fully elucidated.

After culture under osteogenic induction conditions for 21 days, many calcium nodules appeared in the cytoplasm, and Alizarin red staining showed a positive reaction for calcified nodules in differentiated BM-MSCs (Fig. 1B-a). After culture under adipocytic induction conditions for 21 days, many lipid droplets formed in the cytoplasm, and the lipid droplets were successfully stained with Oil Red O (Fig. 1B-b). BM-MSCs displayed positive Alcian blue staining after incubation with chondrogenic medium for 21 days(Fig. 1B-c). Culture under neurogenic induction conditions for 21 days changed the cellular morphology from a spindle-shaped morphology to a multipolar and stellate morphology, and the BM-MSCs grew many branches and formed many synapses on the cell surface, as indicated by the white arrows (Fig. 1B-d). The results of immunofluorescence staining revealed the expression of the neural cell markers Nestin(Fig. 1C-a)and MAP-2 (Fig. 1C-b), while undifferentiated cells did not express Nestin(Fig. 1C-c)or MAP-2 (Fig. 1C-d). As shown in Supplementary Material 3, the BM-MSCs surface antigens CD73, CD90, CD105, Sox-2, and OCT-4 were positively expressed, while CD34 and CD45 were not expressed, as identified by flow cytometry.BM-MSCs administration reduced mortality. All sham-operated mice survived. BM-MSCs treatmentprominently improved the survival rate during ALI compared to LPS (Fig. 2A; P < 0.05).BM-MSCsadministration reduced systemic inflammation. The serum levels of CXCL-1 (Fig. 2B; P < 0.05), IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 2C; P < 0.05), IL-8 (Fig. 2D; P < 0.05), and TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 2E; P < 0.05) were prominently increased within 6 h and decreased at 12 h and 24 h compared to Sham. The administration of BM-MSCs prominently prevented the increase in serum levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, CXCL-1, and TNF-\u03b1 compared to LPS (P < 0.05). BM-MSCs administration improved oxidative stress parameters. The expression of SOD (Fig. 2F), MDA (Fig. 2G), GSH (Fig. 2H), and MPO (Fig. 2I",

As shown in Supplementary Material 4, LPS injection increased the Evans blue content in lung tissue compared to Sham (P < 0.01). BM-MSCs treatment attenuated the Evans blue content in lung tissue compared to LPS (P < 0.01).",

BM-MSCs were spindle-like cells. (B) Detection of the multilineage differentiation potential of BM-MSCs. Many calcium nodules appeared in the cytoplasm, and Alizarin red staining showed a positive reaction for calcified nodules in BM-MSCs that differentiated under osteogenic induction conditions for 21 days (a). Many lipid droplets formed in the cytoplasm of cells cultured under adipocytic induction conditions for 21 days and lipid droplets were successfully stained with Oil Red O (b). BM-MSCs were positive for Alcian blue staining after incubation with chondrogenic medium for 21 days (c). The cellular morphology changed from a spindle-shaped morphology to a multipolar and stellate morphology, and the BM-MSCs grew many branches and formed many synapses (white arrows) on the cell surface after culture under neurogenic induction conditions for 21 days (d). (C) The results of immunofluorescence staining. High expression of Nestin (a) and MAP-2 (b), markers of neural cells, was detected in differentiated BM-MSCs, while Nestin (c) and MAP-2 (d) were not detected in undifferentiated BM-MSCs.
