Governments have aimed to \"flatten the curve\" of infections by introducing measures to decrease physical contact between individuals, including implementing travel restrictions, enforcing border closures, and encouraging social distancing (Block et al., 2020; Chinazzi et al., 2020; de Haas et al., 2020; Hsiang et al., 2020; Phan and Narayan, 2020; Ruktanonchai et al., 2020) . In 2020, the United States federal government implemented travel restrictions and travel warnings for heavily-infected regions beginning in late January and early February, and state and local governments issued \"stayat-home\" and social distancing orders by mid-March (Peirlinck et al., 2020) . As a result, American travel behaviors have dramatically changed in terms of origins, destinations, modes, and travel frequency due to COVID-19 and the associated health and government mobility orders (Barbieri et al., 2020; De Vos, 2020) .",

Improvements were assumed to be at least partially due to the public's observance of the executive orders. However, different groups of the population may have engaged in different degrees of change in behaviors as shown by travel distance, frequency, modal shift, work schedules, and remote working (Kramer and Kramer, 2020) . In fact, medical records suggest that individuals within urban areas have faced different hospitalization rates and fatality rates per capita depending on their economic status . In addition, a longitudinal survey in the United States indicates a smaller proportion of lower-income respondents shifted to remote work by July than did higher-income respondents (Circella, 2020) . The different changes in behavior within different groups are worthy of a special study in order for policy makers to make effective policies and maintain social equity in future decision making.",

Nowadays, it has been known that travelers' mobility is well characterized by variables such as the travel distance, approximate spatial range of travel, and the frequency of uniquely visited locations. Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2008) defined an approximate range of activity space as the \"radius of gyration\" (the average distance to observed locations from the center of mass of all sets of observations for an individual traveler). Based on estimated mobile phone user trajectories within Voronoi cells, the researchers found that the trip distance distributions can be modeled with great accuracy as a function of the radius of gyration, which is a function of the measurement period. Additional literature reports that individual human mobility follows highly repetitive, predictable patterns (e.g., homeoffice and home-school) on a daily basis (Schneider et al., 2013; Song et al., 2010) . Therefore, it is possible to estimate one's socioeconomic variables based on data obtained from mobile devices (Frias-Martinez et al., 2010; Soto et al., 2011) , though the estimation accuracy depends on urban structures. As Prestby et al. (2020) found in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, individual human mobility patterns seem to have clear differences among different socioeconomic groups especially where practical residential segregation exists.",

As of early 2021, few longitudinal studies have been conducted on COVID-19-related mobility using spatially disaggregated cell phone location data. It is hard to conclude at a nationwide level that the observed differences in mobility patterns were due to inequity rather than to actions based on enacted policies or personal beliefs. In fact, observed mobility patterns also varied across states that imposed different degrees of travel restrictions (Abouk and Heydari, 2021) . The linkage between human mobility patterns during the pandemic and economic status are especially worth studying within a region under a uniform policy. It also should be noted that most existing research in this topic relies on proprietary mobility metrics, so fundamental variables characterizing human mobility (e.g., radius of gyration) have rarely been reported. If records correctly suggest that the disproportionality in COVID-19 fatalities is correlated with disparity among income groups of the population and their different levels of mobility, it would naturally allude to a possible correlation between economic status and change in mobility during the pandemic.",

In the United States, one census tract represents a community that represents a somewhat-homogeneous cluster of approximately 4,000 residents. The ACS was overlaid at the resolution of United States census tracts using a circular area with 0.5-mi diameter around each traveler's median latitude and longitude of the first and last records of each day during the study periods. When the circular cordon overlapped multiple census tracts, the weighted average of the census incomes was considered to be that person's most probable income. While each observation was collected on a roadway, it is reasonable to assume each observation was geographically in or near users' residential neighborhood when the data were aggregated (Chen et al., 2014) . This geographical assumption is a methodological limitation of our research. However, a reasonable level of accuracy was expected because Houston is known as one of the most residentially segregated metropolises in the United States (Fry and Taylor, 2012) . Overlaying income typically commits an ecological fallacy to some extent; however, the segregated nature of Houston neighborhoods lessens this fallacy, and the projected income in this paper are conceptually similar to the likely degree of financial appanage. The procedure narrowed down our samples to 10,398 individuals who were presumed to reside within Greater Houston (Fig. 1) .",

However, the correlation turned out to be strongly negative in April (\u03c1 = \u22120.83). The number of distinct visited locations had strong negative correlations with the income level both in the baseline (\u03c1 = \u22120.97) and in April (\u03c1 = \u22120.98).

While per-trip distance had a strong negative correlation with the income bracket in the baseline (\u03c1 = \u22120.90) and in April (\u03c1 = \u22120.7 6), the differences did not seem as evident as the other variables.",

There was a strong negative correlation (\u03c1 = \u22120. 86) between income and number of distinct visited locations when comparing April values to baseline values. The number of distinct visited locations was reduced by 59.6 percent for individuals with a projected income bracket of $80,000 or larger, but it was reduced by only 47.5 percent for individuals with a projected income bracket of $20,000 or less, compared to baseline travel distances. The figure also suggests smaller changes in mobility among different economic brackets past $50,000 a year, as supported by all the three aforementioned measures. In median per-trip distance, there was a moderate negative rank correlation between per-capita income and the change in April from the baseline (\u03c1 = \u22120.48). The drop in the radius of gyration for the higher-income groups can be partially explained in the context of larger baseline radii of gyrations in baselines (January and February).",

With the result of the travel distance alone, one might think the observed difference was largely due to the fact that tracts with higher income are located in the western center of Houston and thus enabled the residents to travel shorter distances during the executive orders. However, the smaller disparities in the radius of gyration and per-trip distance implies that people in higher-income tracts likely made fewer numbers of trips than those in lower-income tracts.

In general, trip distance distribution shifts towards zero when the radius of gyration becomes smaller (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2008) . While the data do not tell the reason behind the observed increase, it is likely that there was a fundamental change in people's trip choice in the midst of the executive orders. Therefore, caution should be exercised when one tries to apply conventional travel choice models to data collected during travel restrictions. It is possible that people made fewer pass-by stops at attractions, such as restaurants and coffee shops, in April than they did in the baseline period. However, further research would be needed to identify the reasons behind the observed increase in per-trip distance.",

Since those preceding nationwide studies used aggregated location data to compare mobility across a nation, it is noteworthy that the disparity in mobility adaptation was observed among different income groups within a metropolitan statistical area where uniform executive orders were enforced. The results were in line with media speculations, which might explain a reason behind the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19: people with low income did not have a practical choice to stay at home. Because research indicates that racial residential segregation in Houston had already been associated with poor-self reported health before the COVID-19 outbreak (Anderson and Oncken, 2020) , it was likely that the pandemic had amplified inequity in the society.",

Although it is difficult to eliminate the effects of confounders completely, it would be ideal to control the variable if the data availability and a research design allows. Researchers would get results closer to the \"ground truth\" if the true demographics of pseudonymized mobility data were available. For example, essential businesses, such as grocery stores and gas stations, remained open during the executive orders, but there is little research that took such factors into account because such mobility data are rarely available to the public. When it comes to economic status, disposable income, current assets, and net assets could be better indicators of financial leeway than pre-tax income if such variables are available in future research.",
