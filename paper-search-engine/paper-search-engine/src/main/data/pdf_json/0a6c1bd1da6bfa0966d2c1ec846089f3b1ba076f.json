SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers sIC formation in prone 54 individuals. Activation of Fc\u03b3RIII/CD16 expressing immune cells by sICs precedes a humoral 55 response to SARS-CoV2 infection. sICs and infection add to IgG afucosylation, further 56 enhancing Fc\u03b3RIII/CD16 activation by opsonized targets. High inflammation induces further 57 sIC mediated immune cell activation ultimately leading to an escalating immunopathology. 58 59 60 Abstract 61 A dysregulated immune response with high levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies 62 characterizes patients with severe or critical COVID-19. Although a robust IgG response is 63 traditionally considered to be protective, excessive triggering of activating Fc-gamma-receptors 64 (Fc\uf067Rs) could be detrimental and cause immunopathology. Here, we document that patients 65 who develop soluble circulating IgG immune complexes (sICs) during infection are subject to 66 enhanced immunopathology driven by Fc\u03b3R activation. Utilizing cell-based reporter systems 67 we provide evidence that sICs are predominantly formed prior to a specific humoral response 68 against SARS-CoV-2. sIC formation, together with increased afucosylation of SARS-CoV-2 69 specific IgG eventually leads to an enhanced CD16 (Fc\uf067RIII) activation of immune cells 70 reaching activation levels comparable active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease. Our 71 data suggest a vicious cycle of escalating immunopathology driven by an early formation of 72 sICs in predisposed patients. These findings reconcile the seemingly paradoxical findings of 73 high antiviral IgG responses and systemic immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19. 74 75",

Since sICs are commonly associated 653 with immunopathology in autoimmunity (23, 24, 61) and several studies have described that a 654 variety of specific auto-antibodies can be detected in certain critically ill COVID-19 patients 655(62-64), we could not identify a distinct culprit antigen linked to sIC formation when searching 656 for prototypical autoantibodies. However, as sIC formation is strongly reminiscent to SLE and 657 sICs initiate a common terminal pathway of inflammation we classified patients as sIC-prone 658 or non-sIC-prone (graphical abstract). Of note, besides sIC formation a range of additional 659 phenotypical abnormalities shared between B cell populations in autoimmune disorders 660 exemplified by active SLE and severe COVID-19 have been observed. This includes the 661 pronounced engagement of extrafollicular B cell responses, associated with the activation of 662 effector B cells lacking na\u00efve (IgD) and memory markers (CD27) as well as class-switched 663 antibody secreting cells (62).664   We suggest a hidden predisposition in sIC-prone patients resulting in a strong early 665 inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection possibly being a trigger for further sIC 666formation and the generation of afucosylated SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Very recent work reports that 667 an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the de novo IgG production against multiple 668 autoantigens. In this study, 60-80% of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients exhibited anti-669 cytokine IgG (ACA) (65). The authors show that ACA levels and specificity change over time 670 during hospitalization, suggesting ACA induction in response to viral infection and 671 inflammation. Further, it has been shown that pre-existing neutralizing anti-type I interferon 672 antibodies, which can be found in about 10% of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, 673 are related to the highest risk of developing life-threatening COVID-19 disease (66). Therefore, 674 the de novo induction of anti-cytokine auto-antibodies in a large proportion of hospitalized 675 COVID-19 patients as described by Chang et al. (65), might indeed represent a source of 676 circulating sICs in COVID-19. In such a scenario, immune responses are deviated first by an 677 immunodepletion of critical cytokines and second through the formation of pathological sICs 678 which trigger immunological damage. We show that critically diseased patients exhibit 679 significantly higher levels of reactive sICs compared to less severely diseased patients. Notably, 680 CD16 activation levels in patients with critical disease were comparable to those measured in 681 SLE patients, where circulating sICs have long been shown to crucially contribute to tissue 682 damage and disease manifestations (67, 68). In addition, sIC responses can be found 683 significantly earlier in critically diseased patients, which was associated with a fatal disease 684",

It can be hypothesized that 692 the formation of sICs in predisposed patients initiates a vicious circle of Fc\u03b3R-mediated 693 inflammation leading to an increase of IgG afucosylation, followed by enhanced Fc\u03b3R 694 activation by SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, further contributing to inflammation and, 695 conceivably, to de-novo sIC formation. Indeed, there is evidence in this direction from a clinical 696 perspective provided by a recent study that finds the administration of intravenous 697 immunoglobulin (IVIg) to alleviate COVID-19 disease (70). Although no direct proof, this 698 heavily implies that the saturation of Fc\uf067Rs mitigates immunopathology as previously reported 699",
