            "text": "Computational models for large, resurgent epidemics are recognized as a crucial tool for predicting the spread of infectious diseases. It is widely agreed, that such models can be augmented with realistic multiscale population models and by incorporating human mobility patterns. Nevertheless, a large proportion of recent studies, aimed at better understanding global epidemics, like influenza, measles, H1N1, SARS, and COVID-19, underestimate the role of heterogeneous mixing in populations, characterized by strong social structures and geography. Motivated by the reduced tractability of studies employing homogeneous mixing, which make conclusions hard to deduce, we propose a new, very fine-grained model incorporating the spatial distribution of population into geographical settlements, with a hierarchical organization down to the level of households (inside which we assume homogeneous mixing). In addition, population is organized heterogeneously outside households, and we model the movement of individuals using travel distance and frequency parameters for interand intra-settlement movement. Discrete event simulation, employing an adapted SIR model with relapse, reproduces important qualitative characteristics of real epidemics, like high variation in size and temporal heterogeneity (e.g., waves), that are challenging to reproduce and to quantify with existing measures. Our results pinpoint an important aspect, that epidemic size is more sensitive to the increase in distance of travel, rather that the frequency of travel. Finally, we discuss implications for the control of epidemics by integrating human mobility restrictions, as well as progressive vaccination of individuals.",

The heavy socio-economical burden of epidemics has been demonstrated repeatedly during crises like SARS 5 , Ebola 6 or recent COVID-19 7 .

Also underpinned by homogeneous mixing models, we find many flattening the curve-type solutions that try to reduce the reproduction number R 0 ; on the other hand, R 0 is found to have little influence on the final size of large-scale epidemics 20 , as well as being hard to estimate in a real-world context 21 . The over-simplification of social organization lacks the complexity of global scale population organization 22 , which is dictated by geographical, historical, demographic and economic factors. Consequently, numerical simulation of such simplified models can lead to over-or underestimations in terms of epidemic size 10,16,23 or duration 8, 12, 15, 17 .",

Chen et al. 26 show that overlapping in communities leads to increased infection prevalence and a higher spread velocity in the early stages of emerging infections; Salath\u00e9 et al. 4 show that the dynamics of epidemics is influenced by the structure of communities, which, in turn, has implications on immunization strategies for large epidemics; Shang et al. 27 show that overlapping communities and a higher network average degree accelerate spreading; Stegehuis et al. 28 show that the structure of communities has a significant influence on the behavior of percolation on networks, as community structure can stimulate or suppress spreading, based on the mesoscopic set of communities. Further incorporating human mobility and contact patterns increases the realism of an epidemic model. We note the work of Liu et al. 21 which shows that the reproduction number R 0 has a much higher variability than expected, due to the heterogeneity of contact networks. Fueled by a data driven approach, the authors propose a multiplex representation of the population. Mistry et al. 22 provide accurate age-stratified contact matrices for a large number of countries further motivating the need for a heterogeneous approach in disease modeling. Sattenspiel et al. 29 extend a SIR model with five fixed patterns of mobility, but use otherwise large compartments for modeling the population structure. Watts et al. 20 propose a fully synthetic hierarchical block model, aimed at reproducing multiple epidemic waves, but without integrating realistic distances between communities, or any correlation to real-world human settlement organization. Additionally, Salath\u00e9 et al. 30 analyze contact networks in the USA and confirm that heterogeneity is essential on the larger scale, but it is reliable enough to assume homogeneous contact inside small communities (like high schools). This conclusion reinforces our choice for partitioning the population into very fine-grained communities (to the level of households), and further simplification of the small communities' topology, from a social network, to a stochastic block model 31 .",

Thus, we propose the novel geo-hierarchical population mobility model (GHPM) which lies at the crossroads of population organization and mobility, both of which are key aspects to consider when targeting realistic large-scale resurgent epidemic outbreaks. We propose the novel idea of distributing a population into spatially organized communities (i.e., human settlements), which are then organized into a hierarchy of administrative divisions (i.e., district, neighborhood, street, block, household). Thus, the population is partitioned with very high granularity all the way down to household-/family-level, containing just a few individuals, but where the transmission risks are highest 34 . Embedded into our population model, we further propose a novel mobility algorithm based on the geographical distance between settlements and their size, which determines the complexity of the underlying hierarchical structure. Finally, targeting the reliable reproduction of resurgent epidemics, we analyze the complex interplay between the population mobility model of GHPM and outbreak dynamics by adopting a modified SIR model with patient relapse. Altogether, the resulting framework is analyzed using detailed computer simulations.",

Therefore, we further provide a statistical overview of seasonal, eradicated and ongoing epidemics worldwide, as such: seasonal influenza in Germany (2014), influenza in California (winter season 2016/2017), global H1N1 cases (2009), measles in Indonesia (2016), Pertussis in California (2010), and data on COVID-19, with estimates on global epidemic sizes for 2020.",

Despite of the political, historical and geographical factors influencing the boundaries of countries and states, human populations have always flocked together into settlements 41 . As such, our proposed GHPM model starts from a targeted, real-world geographical area A (e.g., a continent, a country, a state), quantified by a set S of (real) settlements, which represent the basis of human organization and cooperation. In contrast to the abstract representation of network communities, each settlement s i \u2208 S is modeled according to real-world data, using its geographical position s i (x i , y i ) (i.e., longitude, latitude) and estimated size \ufffd * (s i ) (i.e., number of individuals). Next, we create a multi-level hierarchical structure under each settlement based on its estimated population \ufffd * (s i ) . This hierarchy of administrative divisions is summarized in Table 1 , with the lowest level corresponding to households, each containing a family of average size h size 42 (more details in \"Methods\"). The number of households n h for a settlement is estimated as n h = \ufffd * (s i )/h size , where h size is given by a distribution (see SI.1). From households upward, in the administrative hierarchy of each settlement, we define blocks, whose number n b is given by the number of households as n b = (n h ) \u03b2 , followed by streets ( n s = (n b ) \u03b2 ), neighborhoods ( n n = (n s ) \u03b2 ), districts ( n d = (n n ) \u03b2 ), and finally the root of the hierarchy represented by the settlement. The impact of choosing different branching factors \u03b2 is detailed in SI.2. Also, note that the number of hierarchical levels added to each settlement depends on its estimated size \ufffd * (s i ) as defined in Table 1 . Thus, we differentiate between the complexity of population organization in villages, towns, cities and metropolises (with 2-5 levels accordingly).",

The first, is implemented by long distance travel restrictions, a measure already adopted world-wide, throughout 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and with notable results 45, 46 . In GHPM, this restriction is obtained by reducing the travel distance parameter , as discussed in the previous section. The second, is implemented in GHPM by adding a progressive linear vaccination policy. More precisely, we pick random, not currently infected individuals, and transfer them to a permanent recovered state R * . The vaccination policy is not started at t = 0 , but only after t = 365 days in our 5-year long simulation frame- www.nature.com/scientificreports/ work (this approach mirrors the current COVID-19 situation better). Afterwards, a random set of individuals are selected every single iteration as the number of immune individuals grows progressively. Figure 5a depicts the impact of two mobility restriction policies of reducing travel to 30% (orange line), respectively to just 10% (red line) of the original, unrestricted travel. We note that, for increasing \ufffd > 0.2 , even very strict measures do not guarantee a proportional reduction in epidemic size \u03c6. Figure 5b summarizes the impact of two immunization policies of vaccinating individuals at a rate of 60% per year (5%/month; green line), respectively 90% per year (7.5%/month; red line), compared to no vaccination at all (gray line). Here we observe that, as the travel distance parameter increases, even an aggressive vaccination policy is unable to guarantee a proportional reduction in epidemic size \u03c6 . Of course, this is, in part, a consequence of our choice to implement the vaccination policy with a 1 year delay in our simulations. Further experimenting with different vaccination delays, or vaccination rates is outside the scope of this paper but can make an interesting follow-up research topic.",

The epidemic sizes distribution always becomes bimodal, as the first mode correlates to unsuccessful, local outbreaks, and the second mode correlates to successful, global scale outbreaks (see Fig. 3a,d) . Different, network science approaches have also been used in computational epidemics, like a forest-fire topology 48 , and social networks with two 49 and multiple dimensions 50 .

While this number has an inherent value for compartmental models with homogeneous mixing, R 0 could also be estimated for a more complex deterministic multiscale model. Nevertheless, estimating or redefining R 0 , would not improve any relationship to the final epidemic size in stochastic multiscale models 20 , like our GHPM. The large, non-deterministic variations in epidemic size (Fig. 3e,f) , and the resurgent characteristic (Fig. 3b,c) do not result from initial conditions like R 0 = /\u00b5 , but rather from \"black swan\" 52 events, during which an infected individual travels from a compromised household (or settlement) to new uninfected settlements. In this way, the fluctuating yearly epidemic size \u03c6 y is mostly decided by the increasing travel distance and travel frequency to susceptible populations. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In addition, we show that, apart from rare, long distance travel events, the population structure is a decisive factor in influencing the speed and impact of epidemic outbreaks. For example, the recent COVID-19 epidemic has a very varied evolution across countries (suggested by the distribution in Fig. 1b) , ranging from less than 1-10% prevalence in 2020. These variations can also be attributed to the intensity, delay, and strength of implementing restrictions 23 . Even though non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are a relevant form of active control on epidemic duration and size 9 , our observations pinpoint that the GHPM population organization can achieve stochastic dynamics in epidemic size as large and heterogeneous as empirically observed fluctuations.",

In this sense, we show that travel restrictions, like reducing , and (or equivalently h ) in our model (distance and frequency), can determine a significant change in the resulting epidemic size \u03c6 y , comparable to stronger social intervention strategies like vaccination or total quarantine. Specifically, we find a phase transition from local to global epidemic around \ufffd > 0.1 and \ufffd h > 1 . When the two parameters are close to 0, infected individuals are more likely to remain in their original household, and the resulting epidemic is delimited to the local scale ( h size \u226a ). Overall, we conclude that minor modifications in have a higher impact on the size of the epidemic \u03c6 y compared to similar modifications in h . One of the main take-away messages of this study is that we found travel distance to be more significant in increasing epidemic size than travel frequency. Additionally, our results pinpoint that, even an aggressive immunization policy (e.g., vaccination of 60-90% non-infected individuals per year), is unable to guarantee an immediate proportional reduction in epidemic size, given a delay of one year to start the vaccination campaign. To this end, vaccination (at a moderately realistic pace) does not yield lower epidemic sizes than reduced travel distances.",

            "text": "To conclude, major recent outbreaks like Ebola, SARS or COVID-19 repeatedly confront public health authorities with the uncertainty of-how big will it be this time? Unfortunately, current state of the art computational epidemiology can hardly offer accurate answers. Even the most complicated models of infectious spreading require an estimation of the relevant susceptible population. It is much easier to do retrospective studies in which, after an epidemic is observed, the specific parameters are approximated. However, such an approach is often limited because it has reduced relevance for future outbreaks. For instance, the global 1918 Spanish flu pandemic did not stop the 2003 SARS or 2020 COVID-19 pandemics. Even if the planet was less populated and less connected a century ago, the 1918 flu made considerably more victims compared to the potentially more infectious diseases of the XXI century. With the statistics of SARS pointing towards a quick mitigation with relatively low global impact, COVID-19 has had a very different evolution 53 . In the current pandemic context, the population susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 virus is roughly the entire population of the planet. Should we then estimate scenarios with outbreaks concentrated around large populated hubs, or include billions of susceptible individuals spread across the entire planet? Perhaps the ultimate question is simply formulated as-what is the epidemic size distribution for a given infectious pathogen?",

The major advantage over other single scale, multiscale, or network models is that it can be extended to very large scales (e.g., continental or global) without implying homogeneous populations. This way, a modeled epidemic can be seen as multiple smaller epidemics occurring at different times, in different sub-populations. In this context, most of the infectious spreading happens locally, and global spreading is determined by rare distant travel. Because the epidemic size distribution is remarkably susceptible to the population structure, we suggest that epidemic control can be improved through adequate strategies applied to the boundaries inherently delimiting large, multiscale populations. We believe that future studies can adopt and extend our concept of geo-hierarchical population mobility to study progressively more realistic epidemic models of infectious spreading.",

In (a), most of the population is quickly infected ( \u03c6 y = 95% ), as a typical outbreak surges rapidly only once and then drops back to zero. By contrast, in (b,c), the two epidemics exhibits visible resurgence, and infect very different (and smaller) proportions of individuals ( \u03c6 y = 2.9% , and \u03c6 y = 14.7% ). (d-f) Corresponding epidemic size distributions for all three depicted scenarios in (a-c). We ran 2000 simulations each, on a population model of Germany with 533,160 individuals and simulation time t = 2000 days. (d) Strictly bimodal epidemic size \u03c6 y distribution on a homogeneously mixing population (all individuals placed in one single-scale settlement). (e,f) Population is structured according to GHPM, and the two setups differ in the travel distance parameter (0.1 and 0.35). Both (e) and (f) depict distributions of similar size with modes near \u03c6 y = 0 , and an approximately uniform distribution for 0 < \u03c6 y < 0.2 . From a qualitative standpoint, both distributions are comparable to real epidemic data in Fig. 1. The insets summarzie the cumulative frequency distributions CFD.
