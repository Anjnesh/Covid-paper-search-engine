Previously, this drug has proven effective in vitro antiviral activity against Ebola, Nipah, and Respiratory syncytial virus. Subsequently, the drug was shown to be effective against other coronaviruses such as SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) both in vitro and in animal models (Scavone et al., 2020) . The SARS CoV-2 virus replication takes place using a particular enzyme known as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Researchers proved that the remdesivir could block this enzyme necessary for viral replication (Gordon et al., 2020) . Remdesivir is an adenosine nucleoside analog, which incorporates into viral RNA chains, causing premature breakage by interfering with viral replication. Many clinical trials were underway assessing remdesivir as a potential treatment for COVID-19 treatment. In China, during the period of February-March 2020, a clinical trial on remdesivir showed ineffective treatment of COVID-19 patients and caused many harmful effects . In March 2020, scientists proved that the progression of COVID-19 was reduced in rhesus macaque monkeys after treatment with remdesivir (Williamson et al., 2020) . On April 29, 2020, the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) reported that the drug provided a 31% faster recovery in 11 days. On the other hand, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was carried out by the United States National Institutes of Health. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by up to nine more days of 100 mg daily) or placebo for up to 10 days of treatment. The study suggested that remdesivir was found to be effective in COVID-19 patients and reduced the recovery time from 15 to 11 days. In August 2020, the FDA expanded the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the use of remdesivir in treating COVID-19 patients. Thereafter, on October 22, 2020, FDA approved and also revised the EUA to authorize the use of this drug.",

Hence, it could be a promising agent for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is also an RNA virus . Favipiravir is metabolized to its active form favipiravirribofuranosyl-5\u2032-triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP), which inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme. It interferes with the elongation of the RNA strand and prevents viral replication (Furuta et al., 2009) . In China, a clinical trial on favipiravir was initiated in February 2020. The test was conducted on 80 patients by the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases. The potent antiviral action was noticed with fewer adverse effects. CT (computerized tomography) scan results revealed the eradication of the virus in 91% of people (Cai et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2020) . Later, in Wuhan, the research was carried out in 240 COVID-19 patients and the scientists observed that the patients treated with favipiravir have recovered from cough and fever, but no changes were observed in patients receiving prolonged ventilation (Regalado, 2020) . On March 22, 2020, Italy approved this drug for clinical trials only in the severely affected COVID-19 patients. In India, the drug was approved for treatment under the name \"Fabiflu\".",

In the malarial parasites, hydroxychloroquine accumulate in the lysosomes, increase the pH of the vacuole, inhibits the ability of parasites to proteolyze the hemoglobin and prevents the growth of the parasite (Lei et al., 2020) . Likewise, in human cells, the drug increased the pH in endosomes and prevents the entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. The Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enzymes are normally expressed at the outer surface of human cells. ACE2 serves as the functional receptor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 (Venkat . The terminal glycosylation of ACE2 is inhibited by hydroxychloroquine, prevents the interaction of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 \"spike\" protein, and hence inhibits the entry of the virus. Clinical studies from China showed that the hydroxychloroquine reduced the risk of progression to severe illness in COVID-19 patients . In February 2020, a non-randomized study in a small sample size from France shows that the hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin treatment reduced the viral load in COVID-19 patients (Gautret et al., 2020) . Another study from France reported that the hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin have no strong antiviral activity in severely affected COVID-19 patients (Molina et al., 2020) . However, in april 2020, Hydroxychloroquine was approved by FDA for emergency use. Based on the clinical research analysis and scientific data, the FDA reported that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in treating COVID-19 and revoked the emergency use authorization in June 2020.",

            "text": "Over the past century, numerous successful attempts have been made to develop vaccines for polio, cholera, measles, typhoid, and tetanus. Apart from attenuated vaccines, conjugate and subunit vaccines are also proved to be efficient against pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis (Kim et al., 2020) . Currently, more than 150 vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 are under development at various stages. There has been an increased focus on the pre-clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines by many research institutes and vaccine manufacturers around the world. Currently, the predominant vaccine of Medicine (U.S.), 2020-2021d). Russia's first approved COVID-19 vaccine is Sputnik V. It is an adenoviral DNA-based vaccine. The phase III trial of Sputnik V is reported to be 91.6% efficacy against COVID-19 illness patients (Jones and Roy, 2021) . The vaccines currently in clinical trials are summarized in Table 2 . The cold storage of vaccines is crucial to reduce the loss of stability, and immunogenicity. The two promising COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, including BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna are to be stored in ultra-cold storage conditions at \u221270\u00b0C and \u221218\u00b0C, respectively. These vaccines are encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) which have the advantage of delivering the mRNA by protecting them from enzyme degradation and it can effectively deliver mRNA vaccines into the cell cytosol through a series of endocytosis mechanisms. (Acharya et al., 2021; Baden et al., 2021) . The ultra-cold storage of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine would be unsuitable for low and middle-income countries due to a shortage of cold-chain infrastructure. The maintenance of mRNA-LNPs in a frozen form will be a major challenge for transport, storage, and distribution in developing countries, resulting in reduced immunization rates. On the other hand, AstraZeneca's vaccine can be stored, transported, and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (2-8\u00b0C) for at least six months. Moreover, comparing to the other types of vaccine, the cost of the AstraZeneca's vaccine is very less (around $2-4 per dose). Hence, it can be easily produced for a larger population and distributed using existing medical facilities in developing countries.",

We have summarized the current status of the repurposing drugs, including remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinvar/ retinovar, hydroxychloroquine, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The development of new drugs is a complex and prolonged process. Hence, repurposed drugs could be an alternative to combat COVID-19. However, vaccines under clinical trials are showing great results compared to the other therapeutics options. More than 100 vaccines are under study, among that only four vaccines have been approved by WHO for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The WHO encourages COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers in many countries and ensures its safety in immunization. The vaccines were found to be safe for adults, including those with pre-existing auto-immune disorders. Several vaccines have received emergency use authorization in many countries but careful monitoring in high-risk individuals over the age of 60 is still required.",
