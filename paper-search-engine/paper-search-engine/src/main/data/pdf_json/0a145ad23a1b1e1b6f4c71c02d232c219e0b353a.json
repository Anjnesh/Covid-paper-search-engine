Hence, dental schools and universities are under constant demand for providing education that follows science and practice and involves solving real-life situations, interpersonal interactions with patients, practice-based learning and gaining clinical experience [1] . Listed above are also of paramount importance in current dental school curricula, since it is widely recognized that an effective training of dental students improves both the performance and success of clinical procedures performed later by them [2] . Further, the essential dental professional clinical skills include: diagnosis and treatment planning, preventative measures and patient treatment and rehabilitation [3] . In order to prepare students for their future professional life, teachers of dental schools and universities foster their readiness and confidence for direct patient care, boosting their psychomotor skills, expanding knowledge in terms of diagnosis, treatment options and planning thus upgrading their clinical competences [4] . Accordingly, it is upon universities and dental schools to create academic environment, provide materials, equipment and facilities that best suit students to attain competencies for their future professional life and consequent benefit for the patients.",

Although different teaching methods and educational standards may influence the graduates' confidence and competence [8] , modern dental teaching managed to create 'fully qualified beginners' [9] , prepared for life learning process with possession of adequate knowledge together with cognitive, interpersonal and clinical skills. Furthermore, important aspect of achieving competency is the selfconfidence and learning ability [3] . Apart from the training environment, the students' attitude and self-confidence in handling a specific procedure are crucial for the final outcome of the learning process [2] . Thus, self-confidence is an extent of dental graduate's competence. The importance of achieving self-confidence is an asset in enhancing the competencies, whereas it is crucial to teach a student to self-evaluate to avoid overconfidence [10] .",

            "text": "The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in spring of year 2020 has dramatically changed both teaching and learning methods in dental school [11] with strong impact on the knowledge asset of current dental students. It has been claimed that COVID-19 pandemic massively affected clinical dental practice and dental education [12] . The lockdown declared in most countries as an attempt to prevent virus spread, forced universities, dental schools and affiliated hospitals to close their premises for students, teachers and patients while traditional teaching methods have been suspended. The teaching concept of our school before the COVID-19 pandemic was according to curriculum that comprises courses of one or two semesters, that are distributed over 6 years studies and consists of \"face-to-face\" theoretical lectures and practical classes (preclinical or clinical). In the spring semester 2020, due to total lockdown declared in our country, sustaining level of teaching activities in our dental school was transferred to on-line learning platform (Google Classroom 1 ), with dominant pre-recorded theoretical lectures, case presentations and electronic learning tutorials. Similarly to vast majority of worldwide dental schools [13, 14] , dental clinics of our University from that moment were available only for treatment of dental emergencies, and all appointments that students scheduled were postponed since practical courses ceased. Practical courses were introduced back in October 2020 at significantly reduced level and with rigorous preventive measures, while theoretical lectures remained online. There was not synchronized national strategy for system of higher dental education during COVID-19 pandemic, since curricula of all dental schools differ significantly. Therefore, each school has had its own modification of educational process, although the common to all are the cease of practical courses and introduction of some kind of on-line learning. Noteworthy, the positive impact of transition to on-line teaching is reported as improvement of learning efficiency and performances by adopting online learning strategies [15] . Although our school rapidly adopted on-line lecturing and teachers efficiently shifted to distant teaching, students were restrained from direct contact with patients. That affected their ability to apply gained knowledge, develop critical thinking in clinical setting and build experience. Undoubtedly, the switch to distance learning and the lack of practical training during the semester could leave students without proper confidence in performing dental procedures. Many investigations have been performed so far concerning different aspects of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on dental education [16, 17] . However, as far as we are aware none of the published studies compared the students' educational results during COVID-19 pandemic with those gained from previous years although it would be informative from at outcome point of view [18] .",

Selfconfidence scores were analyzed at the level of whole sample as well as observing single questions and question groups according to dental fields. Significance of differences in selfconfidence scores for the whole sample was evaluated using t test and inter-area comparison was done using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post hoc test for pairwise comparisons. Distributions of the scores were compared with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, having in mind that the study group and control contained different number of examinees. When comparing skills within particular dental fields, self-confidence scores missed normal distribution and the analysis at this level was conducted with Kruskal-Wallis test.

Indeed, the achieved response of 74.2% indicated that majority of the whole population to be examined was presented in the sample. Additionally, high response rate was in favour of reducing bias of not representative data. Students scored self-confidence level using five-level Likert like format (from 1-no self-confidence to 5-very confident). Since the response format in the questionnaire consisted of five categories, according to Harpe [20] , we treated these as continuous variables and reported means and standard deviations for each item as well as at the level of whole groups and in particular dental specialities. For the sake of completeness, we reported median value of reported self-confidence on each question. The above mentioned 'intervalistic' approach enabled the use of more powerful parametric mode of analysis. For additional support and findings, we analysed distributions and compared each item in nonparametric mode. As expected, null hypothesis was rejected since significant differences in selfconfidence scores and distribution were found. It can be claimed that 2020 final year dental students experienced notable influence of lack of direct contact with patients and shift to distance learning due to COVID-19 lockdown on their self-confidence in performing routine dental procedures. This is in concordance with reported perception of students and educational staff from University of Otago that the impact of suspension of clinical activities would be extreme [12] .",

Similarly, students in the study from Jordan found Conservative Dentistry as most negatively affected by the COVID-19 lockdown and the authors stated it was comprehendible since the bulk of students' clinical exposure during their final years revolved around Restorative Dentistry [18] . We have included in the questionnaire a significant number of questions based on more complex procedures from Oral Surgery since they are listed as competences in curriculum of our school. Students scored them with lower grades in both study and control group resulting in lower overall grade in the field of Oral Surgery compared to Restorative Dentistry and Removable Prosthodontics. This could be indicative for need of corrective measures in curriculum in this area such as excluding some of competencies or change in teaching modalities for them. Our graduates reported higher scores for simpler Oral Surgery procedures and lower for complex ones and this is in accordance with the findings for graduates from Cardiff and Cork [21] .

Namely, the skills that were gained during the courses that completely finished before the outbreak of COVID 19 were also affected. Also, the self-confidence was affected not only by lowering the perceived level but also by the change in the distribution of scores in observed groups. Disturbed distributions are probably the effect of differences in clinical load needed for proper adoption of different skills.",

A study from Germany also highlighted that students recognise their practical preparation not enough to make them feel comfortable to face the future profession [25] . Hence, it's up to them to address their weaknesses in order to seek further training. Also, it is advisable for dental schools and their authorities to provide additional courses and workshops concerning the raised issue. In support of that is finding of Hattar et al. that nearly two-thirds of students included in their study preferred to be supervised following graduation [18] . What is encouraging is that there are procedures highlighted with higher scores regardless the abrupt change in teaching process and these are from the group of essential dental professional clinical skills [3] such as diagnosis and treatment planning. Although there are authors who stated that many students included in their studies did not feel well prepared for practical courses with online learning alone [26, 27] , the positive aspects of on-line learning were reported both by student and teaching staff, such as higher motivation of students and easier participation resulting in suggested continuation of this educational model in order to improve future dental curricula [25] . Likewise, the sixth year students from Italy evaluated the COVID-19 pandemic modification of teaching method and defined it as significantly \"fair\" concerning the level of interactivity, level of knowledge and level of personal preparation [28] . Thus, it may be considered that implemented distance learning methods gave some results on students gaining comprehensive knowledge. In such a way they have created base for enriching and building their self-confidence in practical skills later.",

However, assuming that the competence and the perception of competence (self-confidence) are different [30] and implying that the level of confidence has implications for practice we implemented the self-confidence survey in our study. Another limitation is that the study was performed in single dental school. Although almost 50% of dental students in our country are attending the school included in this survey, the results cannot be extrapolated at the national level since the curricular differences are significant and the form of educational changes during lockdown was different. Therefore, students in other schools might respond differently [18] , but we strongly believe that the strength of our study lies in an outcome point where educational results, manifested as self-confidence level, were compared with those results of previous year students.",

The 2020 graduating students were the target group of the investigation, because they are on the threshold of the professional career and we anticipated that their self-confidence level would have great impact on their own career in the near future. Furthermore, it has been shown that students in the last year of their study expressed more serious interest in maintaining their practical skills [31] . The data obtained by this research indicate that these students, educated in specific conditions, do not feel safe in performing most of observed clinical procedures and they may have additional educational needs in post-graduation period. This work sheds light on implications regarding distance learning, raising issues in implementing new teaching modalities. It is advisable that dental schools re-evaluate their competency-based education, incorporate variations of distance learning permanently in their curricula, and invest in haptic technology to improve psychomotor skills and also in faculty training for teaching through technology [26] since it is now clear that the pandemic is long lasting [32] and the impacts of it are profound. Even after the contagion curve is flattened, it can be expected long lasting changes in dental clinic practice [33] , as well as in dental education. Therefore, within the stated limitation, findings of this study could be the contribution in recognizing the significance of permanent implementation of educational experiences adopted during COVID-19 pandemic that could be useful in development of new teaching modalities in future dental education. Rising number of studies in this area is the warranty of global efforts to use different experiences in improving pedagogic approaches and preventing detrimental effects of sudden impacts on education process thus promoting collaboration between dental schools.
