            "text": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of motor symptoms and non-motor symptoms (NMS) [1] . Among these NMS, pain is observed in approximately 30%-50% of PD patients and the incidence can increase even to 68%-85% when all types of pain are taken into account [2] . Pain can appear at any time during the disease, and can be present before diagnosis [3] . Pain in PD is frequently under-recognized and is often inadequately treated [4] . As there are different types of pain, it is very important to identify what type of pain is present in the patient for trying to treat it [5] . Dopaminergic therapy may improve dystonic pain, musculoskeletal pain related to rigidity and akinesia, as well as akathisia in PD [6] . Moreover, not only dopamine but other neurotransmitters such as glutamate have been implicated in the modulation of pain in PD [7] . 2 of 12 Safinamide is an oral \u03b1-aminoamide derivative marketed for the treatment of PD with both dopaminergic properties, namely highly selective and reversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase B, and non-dopamimetic properties, namely selective sodium channel blockade and calcium channel modulation, with consequent inhibition of excessive glutamate release [8] . In previous trials, safinamide improved both motor scores and duration of \"on time\", and was also well-tolerated and safe [9, 10] . Furthermore, data from some studies suggest a possible benefit of PD patients after treatment with safinamide in global NMS burden [11, 12] and in some NMS in particular such as sleep, mood or urinary symptoms [13] [14] [15] . With regard to pain, very recently Geroin et al. [16] observed, after 3 months of add-on safinamide therapy, a significant improvement in the primary outcomes (KPPS (KPPS King's Parkinson's Disease Pain Scale), BPI (Brief Pain Inventory) Intensity and Interference and NRS (Numeric Rating Scale)) in 13 PD patients with pain. Post-hoc analysis of some trials suggest a possible effect of safinamide on pain in PD patients [17, 18] , and a recent systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that safinamide is an important adjunct to standard Parkinsonian medication for alleviating pain in PD [19] . Moreover, there is an on-going phase IV multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study about the effect of safinamide on pain in PD patients experiencing motor fluctuations and PD related chronic pain (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03841604 (accessed on 13 August 2021); NCT03841604).",

Subjects completed the KPPS [22] in all visits. The KPPS has been validated as the first specific rating scale to evaluate the burden of pain in the context of PD. The KPPS assesses seven different domains including 14 items corresponding to the diverse modalities of pain identified in PD. Domains 1 (musculoskeletal pain) and 2 (chronic pain) are nociceptive pain; neuropathic pain is included in domains 2 and 6 (discoloration; edema/swelling). Additionally, the scale includes fluctuation-related pain (domain 3), nocturnal pain (such as pain related to restless legs syndrome) (domain 4), orofacial pain (domain 5), and radicular pain (domain 7). Each item is scored by severity (0, none to 3, very severe) multiplied by frequency (0, never to 4, all the time) resulting in a sub-score of 0 to12, the sum of which gives the total score with a theoretical range from 0 to 168. Moreover, a visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for assessing pain (VAS-PAIN) [23] in each visit as well. Specifically, a straight horizontal line of 100 mm was used. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of the parameter to be measured orientated from the left (worst) to the right (best). Information on sociodemographic aspects, factors related to PD, comorbidity, and treatment was collected. Moreover, other scales were administered by protocol in different visits of the study. The methodology of the SAFINONMOTOR study can be consulted in https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/11/3/316/htm (accessed on 13 August 2021) [12] . Importantly, the analysis about the change in pain (KPPS total score) from V1 to V4 was a specific proposed secondary objective in the protocol of the SAFINONMOTOR study.",

Ford's pain classification from 2010 [10] remains the most-cited one and considered five types: musculoskeletal, radicular/neuropathic, dystonic, central or primary pain, and akathisia. Recently, Chaudhuri et al. [22] validated the King's Parkinson s Disease Pain Scale (KPPS), a new scale for assessing pain in PD patients. It includes different types of pain distributed in seven domains: nociceptive pain (musculoskeletal and chronic pain); neuropathic pain (chronic pain, discoloration and edema/swelling, and radicular pain); fluctuation-related pain; nocturnal pain; and orofacial pain. Importantly, different types of pain can be present at the same time in a patient and the management depends on it. To our best knowledge, only one 12-week, single-center, phase IV, prospective observational study analyzed the changes in pain in a cohort of PD patients receiving safinamide (100 mg/day) using the KPPS [16] . The results of the change in the KPPS total score were very similar to our finding (mean \u00b1 SD change from baseline of \u221219.3 \u00b1 10.5; p < 0.05), but the sample was small (N = 13), and the numeric value of the KPPS total score at baseline was not provided (this seems to be about 40 points according to a figure) , and, importantly, they information about the domains of the scale was not given. Although our study is not a double-blind trial like that of Cattaneo et al. [17] , it is a prospective study in which a specific scale to measure the change in pain perception was used, the objective defined \"a priori\", and not a post-analysis analysis.",

In our study, after 6 months with safinamide, pain as a whole and specifically five types of pain improved. With regard to this relation between pain and dopaminergic stimulus, we observed a significant correlation between the improvement in motor complications (UPDRS-IV) and chronic, fluctuation-related and nocturnal pain but unlike Geroin et al. [16] not with pain as a whole (KPPS total score). It suggests that reducing OFF time may improve pain, especially some types of pain. An example are nocturnal disturbances related to motor symptoms, including nocturnal akinesia, early-morning dystonia, painful cramps, tremor, and difficulty turning in bed [28] . Another interesting finding is the correlation observed between the global NMS burden improvement (change from V1 to V4 in the NMSS total score) and the improvement from V1 to V4 in pain as a whole (KPPS total score), and especially in chronic pain and fluctuation-related pain. It is well known that NMS are related in part to motor fluctuations and that reducing OFF time may improve NMS burden [29] . Moreover, NMS burden and chronic pain are related with depression and fatigue [30] [31] [32] , and we observed a correlation between the improvement in chronic pain, fluctuation-related pain and/or nocturnal pain and the improvement in mood and/or physical fatigue after 6-month follow-up. However, in the linear model and after adjustment to baseline KPPS total score, the only predictor of pain improvement was the decrease in the global NMS burden.",

Elevated glutamatergic neurotransmission is observed during neuropathic pain, and an imbalance between dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic systems might contribute to chronic pain in PD [35] . Moreover, deep brain stimulation targeted to the subthalamic nucleus was shown to reduce the glutamatergic overstimulation of the globus pallidus and improve the musculoskeletal and central neuropathic pain [36] . Safinamide is a drug for the treatment of PD with a double mechanism of action, dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic. Safinamide modulates the release of glutamate, and glutamate is believed to be involved in dyskinesia, chronic pain and mood disorders in PD patients [8] . It has been suggested that this second action mechanism could explain at least in part the favorable effect of safinamide in some NMS [11, 13] , but it is not clear whether the dopaminergic action of safinamide could be more potent than that of other MAO-B inhibitors such as rasagiline or if benefits could be related to its effect involving the glutamatergic system, or both [37, 38] . We observed that the improvement in the NMS burden (NMSS total score) observed in 50 PD patients from the SAFINONMOTOR study 6 months after starting with safinamide with a mean dose of 99 mg/day did not significantly differ to the improvement observed at 1 month with a mean dose of 55 mg/day [12] . For pain, the same observation occurred when pain as a whole was considered, although fluctuation-related and discoloration/edema/swelling pain improved significantly at 6-month follow-up with a mean dose of 98.7 mg/day compared to 1-month follow-up with a mean dose of 53.8 mg/day.",

In line with this, a phase IV multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study about the effect of safinamide on pain in PD patients experiencing motor fluctuations and PD related chronic pain (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03841 604; (accessed on 13 August 2021) NCT03841604). Furthermore, the sample size is rather small and, for some variables, the information was not collected in all cases. The results are based on scales that collect the opinion of the patient and we did not include any objective method for assessing pain perception [33] . In fact, the improvement in mood could influence the perception of symptoms and the response in other scales [39] . Four visits were by phone and the effect that COVID-19 pandemic [40] could have in these patients is unclear. On the other hand, this is the first study in which changes on pain in PD patients receiving safinamide have been exhaustively analyzed.",
