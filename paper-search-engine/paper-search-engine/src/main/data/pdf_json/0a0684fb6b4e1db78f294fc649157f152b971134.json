However, the vaccine's efficacy can be compromised in patients with immunodeficiencies or the vaccine-induced immunoprotection suppressed by other comorbidity treatments, such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy. To enhance the protective role of the COVID-19 vaccine, we have investigated a combination of the COVID-19 vaccination with ex vivo enrichment and large-scale expansion of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-reactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Methods: SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors were vaccinated with two doses of the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the vaccinated donors were cell culture-enriched with T cells reactive to peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. The enriched cell cultures were large-scale expanded using the rapid expansion protocol (REP) and the peptide-reactive T cells were evaluated. Results: We show that vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteinbased mRNA COVID-19 vaccine-induced humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in all tested healthy SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors.",

The donors were vaccinated with two doses of the vaccine within a 3-to 4-week interval. Samples, the serum and unclotted blood, were collected during the 2 days before each vaccination and 3-4 weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. Using a microblot system, the sera were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, IgG, or IgM antibodies against the virus proteins: receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S2 subunits of the spike glycoprotein (S2), nucleocapsid protein (NCP), envelope protein (EP), and papain-like protease (PLP). 12 As negative controls, the sera were analyzed for the presence of antibodies specific to human ACE-2 protein 17 or proteins from other coronaviruses: S1 subunit of the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus spike glycoprotein (MERS-CoV), 18 NCP of SARS-CoV, 19 human coronavirus 229E 20 and NL63. 21 As shown in Figure 1A , the COVID-19 vaccination-induced no production of SARS-CoV-2 unrelated antibodies. The COVID-19 vaccination also did not induce the production of antibodies specific to the SARS-CoV-2 NCP, EP, or PLP ( Figure 1B) , which indicated no previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, the vaccineinduced the production of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein. As shown in Figure 1B (middle panel), the RBD-specific IgG antibodies were already induced in all the tested donors after the first dose of the vaccine and their levels were further enhanced after the second dose of the vaccine. Only one donor after the first dose and two donors after the second dose of the vaccine produced IgG antibodies against the S2 subunit of the virus spike glycoprotein ( Figure 1B , middle panels), indicating stronger immunogenicity of its RBD domain. This stronger immunogenicity was even more pronounced for the IgAspecific antibodies where the vaccine-induced the production of only the RBD-specific IgA antibodies ( Figure 1B , left panels). The production of these IgA antibodies was determined only in seven donors because one donor in the cohort was diagnosed IgA deficient. The production of IgM antibodies was detected only in one donor and only after the first dose of the vaccine ( Figure 1B, right middle panel) . The microblot results showed that the COVID-19 vaccination predominantly induced a specific IgA or IgG antibody response against the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and less frequently a specific IgG antibody response against the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.",

We first found that the COVID-19 vaccination did not affect the viability of the isolated donors' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; Figures 2A and 2B ). The vaccination also had a minimal effect on the proportions of T cells and their CD4 + and CD8 + subpopulations (Figures 2A and 2B) . To determine the reactivity of the donors' CD4 + and CD8 + T cells to peptides derived from the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, the donors' PBMCs were stimulated with a pool of peptides derived from the glycoprotein ( Figure 2C ). The peptide pool-stimulated cells were either analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) after a 5 h stimulation or cultured for 12 days in the presence of IL-2 to enrich the cell cultures for the peptide-specific T cells. 23 Following the stimulation of the 12-day-enriched cell cultures with the peptide pool for 5 h, the presence of the peptide-specific T cells was determined by ICS ( Figure 2C ). As shown, the 12-day cell culture enrichment decreased the viability of the cultured cells ( Figure 2D , left panels) but increased the content of T (CD3 + ) cells in the samples obtained after the COVID-19 vaccinations ( Figure 2D , middle panels). The cell culture enrichment also altered the proportions of CD4 + and CD8 + populations of T cells in samples obtained after the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine ( Figure 2D , two right-hand panels in the second row).",

As shown in Figure 3B , the isolated PBMCs from all donors and regardless of the COVID-19 vaccination contained no detectable TNF-\u03b1-, IFN\u03b3-, or TNF-\u03b1/IFN\u03b3-producing CD4 + or CD8 + T cell populations reactive to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-derived peptides. However, the 12-day peptide-mediated enrichment significantly enriched cell cultures with the peptide-reactive T cell populations ( Figure 3C ). As shown, the peptide-enriched cell cultures already contained TNF-\u03b1-producing CD4 + T cell population reactive to the peptides, and this population was significantly higher in cell samples enriched after the second dose of the vaccine than in cell samples enriched before the vaccination ( Figure 3C , top left panel). No effect of the vaccination on the enrichment with the peptide-reactive IFN\u03b3-or TNF-\u03b1/IFN\u03b3-producing CD4 + T cells was observed because no such populations were detected in the 12-day-enriched cell cultures ( Figure 3C , middle and right top panels). However, the vaccination had a robust impact on the enrichment of cell cultures with the peptide-reactive CD8 + T cells. As shown in Figure 3C (bottom panels), the pre-vaccination samples were not enriched with the peptide-reactive CD8 + T cells, showing that the donors failed to attain a peptide-mediated ex vivo enrichment with the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteinreactive CD8 + T cells. This failure was overcome by the COVID-19 vaccination because after the second dose of the vaccine, the cell cultures became significantly enriched with the peptide-reactive CD8 + T cells ( Figure 3C , bottom panels). Moreover, this reactivity was shown not only for the TNF-\u03b1-producing CD8 + T cells ( Figure 3C , bottom left panel) but also for the IFN\u03b3-or TNF-\u03b1/IFN\u03b3producing CD8 + T cells ( Figure 3C , middle and right bottom panels). These data showed that the COVID-19 (Pre, 1st, 2nd) for TNF-\u03b1-, IFN\u03b3-, or TNF-\u03b1/ IFN\u03b3-producing CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are indicated (*p < .05, n = 8 healthy donors, one-way ANOVA with the Dunn's posttest).

These CD8 + T cells were also not detectable in the non-vaccinated donors even after the peptide-mediated enrichment. These data were in line with our recent study where samples from SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors or prostate cancer patients were also largely not enriched with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-specific CD8 + T cells. 31 Even though we cannot entirely exclude that after so many months of the raging pandemic, some of the healthy donors in this study had contracted SARS-CoV-2 unnoticed, then having COVID-19 with no or mild symptoms, 9,10 the donors showed no detectable trances of the virus-specific immunity before the COVID-19 vaccination. Unlike the two control donors (patients) analyzed in this study, the healthy donors of this study had no detectable SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-, NCP-, or membrane protein-specific antibodies in their sera, nor their PBMCs had the potential to become enriched with neither of the virus protein-reactive T cells. However, once these healthy donors obtained two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, the peptidemediated enrichment already produced cell cultures containing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-specific CD8 + T cells. The impact of the COVID-19 vaccine was also specific because it did not promote the peptidemediated enrichment with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid or membrane protein-specific T cells. These data showed that the vaccination was important for increasing the frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-specific CD8 + T cells to the levels that allowed their peptide-mediated enrichment in the cell culture. These findings corroborate previous reports showing increased frequencies of T cells reactive to peptides derived from the tumor-associated antigens in the peptide-enriched cell cultures after the patients' vaccination with ex vivo-produced dendritic cells loaded with whole inactivated tumor cells. 32, 33 Our results showed that humoral and T cell-based immune responses went hand in hand in the tested healthy donors. However, patients with compromised immunity or undergoing therapies that compromise their immunity may not respond well with both arms of the adaptive immunity, and the protective potential of the COVID-19 vaccines can then be undermined in these patients. 34 The large-scale expanded antigen-specific T cells have been utilized for adoptive cellular immunotherapy (ACI) of cancer. 35 Both prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral ACI have also been utilized after the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantations, where viral infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. 36, 37 The restoration of the viral immunity is often successfully attained by the adoptive transfer of the HSC donor's ex vivo expanded virus-specific CD8 + T cells. 36, 37 The expanded SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells could, therefore, be also implemented in these therapeutic strategies to compensate for insufficiencies of the SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immunity. Previous studies have shown that therapeutically relevant numbers of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells could be ex vivo large-scale expanded from COVID-19 convalescent donors. 9,10 The findings of this study showed that these therapeuticrelevant numbers could also be attained after the vaccination of donors with no previous detectable virusspecific immunity nor evidence of a previous COVID-19. The findings of this study showed that the combination of the COVID-19 vaccines with the ex vivo peptidemediated enrichment and large-scale expansion could represent a viable approach for the production of T cells for cellular therapy of COVID-19.",
