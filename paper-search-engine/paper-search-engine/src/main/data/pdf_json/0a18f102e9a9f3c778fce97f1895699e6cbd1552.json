In PD patient-volunteers, we 38 recorded from cortical circuits with scalp-based electroencephalography (EEG) and from 39 subcortical circuits using intraoperative neurophysiology during surgeries for implantation of 40 deep-brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes. We report three major results. First, novel auditory 41 stimuli triggered midfrontal ~4-Hz rhythms, which were attenuated in PD patients but were not 42 linked with cognitive function or novelty-associated slowing. Second, 32% of subthalamic 43 nucleus (STN) neurons were response-modulated; nearly all (94%) of these were also modulated 44 by novel stimuli. Finally, response-modulated STN neurons were coherent with midfrontal low-45 frequency activity. These findings link scalp-based measurements of neural activity with 46 neuronal activity in the STN. Our results provide insight into midfrontal cognitive control 47 mechanisms and how hyperdirect circuits evaluate new information.",

We report 99 three main findings. First, we found that PD patients had decreased midfrontal ~4-Hz rhythms 100 compared to controls; however, these rhythms did not correlate with cognitive status or novelty-101 related slowing.

Oddball task for intraoperative neurophysiology 203 We used an auditory version of a 3-tone oddball task during intraoperative human 204 neurophysiology to capture the response to novelty in the operating room during DBS-electrode 205 implantation surgeries. This task is ideal for research for intraoperative patients whose heads are 206 in a stereotaxic frame during multielectrode recordings because, 1) it is in the auditory domain For the 3-tone oddball task, each trial consisted of one of the following sounds being played: a 216 standard tone that occurred frequently (500 Hz: 50% of trials), a target sound that occurred 217 infrequently (the word \"Go\": 30% of trials; this trial type was used to maintain attention), or a 218 All rights reserved.

These findings suggest that structural and functional changes related to PD affect the 469 circuitry that evaluates and responds to novel stimuli. 470 Our work has several limitations. First, intraoperative recordings present many challenges, 471 including a lack of control over the experimental environment. In particular, our intracranial 472 EEG used adhesive electrodes and the electrode placement was somewhat anterior to the peak of 473 midfrontal ~4-Hz activity our whole scalp EEG experiment captured (i.e. Figure 2E) . These 474 factors may have affected our signal-to-noise ratio, particularly on novel trials with low trial 475 numbers. Because STN single-unit recordings occur in PD patients with attenuated novelty-476 triggered midfrontal ~4-Hz rhythms, it is unknown how our STN findings generalize to non-PD 477 patients or patients with other brain diseases that disrupt frontostriatal circuits.

Wavelets increased from 1-50 Hz in 50 logarithmically-spaced steps, which 183 defined the width of each frequency band, increasing from 3-10 cycles between 1-50 Hz and 184 taking the inverse FFT (Cohen, 2014).

We then cut the length 187 of each signal accordingly for each trial (-500 ms to 1000 ms). These short temporal epochs 188 reflect the wavelet-weighted influence of longer time and frequency periods. Power was 189 normalized by converting to a decibel (dB) scale (10*log10(powert/powerbaseline)), allowing us to 190 directly compare the effects across frequency bands.

In all participants, novel tone trials showed a late (>300 ms) positive component 338 compared to the leveling off observed in the standard tone trials (e.g. the \"P3a\"). This positive 339 deflection appeared to be higher for PD subjects than control subjects; however, the possibility 340 of an underlying low-frequency contribution across the entire ERP in PD subjects suggests that 341 time-frequency analysis might be more effective in isolating unique temporal events that differ 342 between groups.343    We examined power from an a priori tf-ROI (4-8 Hz for 300-400 ms post-tones; blue box in 344Figure 2D). Our linear mixed-effects model revealed a significant effect of tone type on this tf-345 ROI (F(1,73)=51.1, p<0.001), with novel trials showing higher 4-8 Hz band power. However, 346 there were no significant main effects of group, MoCA, or UPDRS Part 3, and there was not a 347 significant interaction between group and trial condition (F(1,73)=3.7, p=0.06). We found that 348 there was no significant relationship between midfrontal ~4-Hz power and novelty-related 349 slowing (Spearman r=-0.16, p=0.17), indicating that average ~4-Hz power across novelty trials 350 may not directly translate to performance on this task. Further, ~4-Hz power in our tf-ROI on 351 novel trials did not correlate significantly with MoCA (Spearman r=0.13, p=0.28) or UPDRS 352Part 3 (for PD group only; Spearman r=-0.24, p=0.10), suggesting that midfrontal activity 353 during this task may not be associated with general cognitive functioning or affected by PD 354 All rights reserved.

This line of work 426 includes data from the Simon reaction-time task (Singh et al., 2018), interval timing tasks (Singh 427 et al., 2021), and working memory manipulations (Itthipuripat et al., 2013). Our past work has 428 found that midfrontal 1-4 Hz frequencies are attenuated in PD (Kim et al., 2017; Parker et al., 429 2014) and strongly correlated with cognitive function during an interval timing task (Singh et al., 430 2021), although in the present study, these bands were novelty-specific but not reliably distinct 431 between control and PD patients (Figure 2, bottom panel and 2D). By contrast, we found that 432 novelty-triggered midfrontal 4-8 Hz oscillations were attenuated in PD but did not correlate with 433 novelty-related slowing. There are multiple generators of mid-frontal low-frequency activity 434 (Zuure et al., 2020), and it is possible that lower frequencies (1-4 Hz) are more commonly 435 evoked by an orienting response (Cavanagh et al., 2018; Parker et al., 2015; Wessel et al., 2016), 436 and higher frequencies (5-8 Hz) represent performance-related cognitive control (Cavanagh & 437 Frank, 2014; Cohen & Donner, 2013; Singh et al., 2018; T\u00f6llner et al., 2017; Zuure et al., 2020).",

This could suggest that the cortex has more 448 sophisticated information integration whereas the STN could more simply carry out reactive449 responses to novelty (e.g. stop & orient). Multiple studies have indirectly demonstrated 450 connectivity between the frontal cortex and the STN in a pathway known as the hyperdirect 451 pathway (Brunenberg et al., 2012; Haynes & Haber, 2013). This pathway was described by 452 Nambu and colleagues (2002) as a cortico-subthalamo-pallidal pathway involved in motor 453 control and output. Intraoperative stimulation studies have demonstrated monosynaptic 454 hyperdirect connectivity (W. Chen et al., 2020; Kelley et al., 2018; Miocinovic et al., 2018; 455 Walker et al., 2012). It is possible that STN-midfrontal spike-field coherence is a result of either 456 hyperdirect connectivity or feed-forward activity via the basal ganglia indirect pathway, or both. 457 Experimentally teasing these contributions apart may require experiments in nonhuman systems 458 in which basal ganglia pathways can be reversibly inactivated while recording from STN 459 neurons. 460 Our data help us understand how PD impacts novelty-related responses. Previous studies have 461 shown that PD patients present with impaired habituation over repeated stimulus presentations, 462 and that attenuated midfrontal theta activity is related to the rate of startle habituation (Cavanagh 463 et al., 2018; K.H. Chen et al., 2016). Importantly, EEG habituation to novelty can effectively 464 classify PD patients (Cavanagh et al., 2018). In our study, PD patients were not as successful as465",
