The present study attempted to estimate the prevalence of child maltreatment during this period, to identify risk factors, and the influence of child maltreatment. A representative sample of 1,062 school-aged children in rural Hubei province was surveyed. Results indicated that the prevalence of family violence, physical violence, emotional abuse and neglect during the lockdown period were 13.9, 13.7, 20.2 and 7.3 percent, respectively, and that of lifetime prevalence were 17.0, 13.9, 14.6 and 6.9 percent, respectively. And most victims did not seek official help. Boys were more likely to experience physical violence. Children from separated/divorced families tended to report more emotional abuse. Those having family members with a history of drug abuse and mental illness were more likely to experience neglect during the lockdown period. All types of child maltreatment were positively associated with self-harm behaviours. These findings highlight the importance of identifying at-risk children immediately and implementing timely intervention programmes to prevent self-harm behaviours for social workers and health professionals.",

The vulnerability of some at-risk groups-such as children and other dependent groups-has been intensified; 'safer-at-home' is decidedly unsafe for a large proportion of the population, as instances of domestic violence and abuse have increased (Kofman and Garfin, 2020) . Lockdown measures and an increased global economic recession are fueling tensions within families, and children are both victims of and witnesses to domestic violence and abuse (United Nations, 2020) . Some studies show that the number of domestic violence cases have increased in Spain and in the UK by 20 and 25 percent respectively during the COVID-19 pandemic (Kofman and Garfin, 2020; Sharma and Borah, 2020) . Furthermore, one study has shown an increase in the proportion of traumatic injuries caused by physical child abuse at Johns Hopkins Children's Center during the pandemic (Kovler et al., 2021) . UNICEF (2020) declared that the risk factors for violence and abuse against children living with restricted movement and socioeconomic decline are increasing, especially as they become cut off from teachers, social service workers and other key sources of support. The issue of the maltreatment of children needs to be addressed urgently, particularly in areas that are hard hit by the pandemic.",

Social vulnerability refers to the inability of people, organisations and societies to withstand adverse impacts from multiple stressors (e.g. abuse, social exclusion and natural hazards) to which they are exposed (Warner, 2007) . The pre-disaster vulnerability factors, like characteristics of the child, the abuser and the family environment (family structure, social status, etc.), play a role in causing child maltreatment (Finkelhor et al., 2013; Ajdukovic et al., 2018; Wan et al., 2020) . Just as Cutter and Emrich (2006) pointed out social vulnerability is the susceptibility of social groups to the impacts of hazards, as well as their resiliency, or the ability to adequately recover from them. So, this study will examine in details the impacts of the pre-disaster factors on child maltreatment.",

The COVID-19 outbreak acts as a catalyst for a considerable rise in child maltreatment by exacerbating household poverty, and studies have shown that unemployment during the epidemic, family income instability and consequent poverty are the important risk factors for child maltreatment (Lawson et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2021; Wong et al., 2021) . In 2020, the widespread economic downturn and income decrease pushed more disadvantaged families under greater financial and parenting pressure. Therefore, greater insecurity and uncertainty may increase domestic violence, including child abuse (Babvey et al., 2021) .",

In substantiated cases of neglect, single-parent homes have been shown to have the highest prevalence among those at risk of it (Afifi et al., 2015) . Specifically, in rural China, a single-parent household is also a predictor of child maltreatment (Wan et al., 2020) . Single parenthood may put strain on a family's financial resources, leading to more work hours for the parent. This, in turn, limits time to care for the children, increasing the risk of maltreatment, especially neglect (Berger, 2004) . Single-parent families face not only greater financial pressure but also the burden of care and education, due to the closure of schools during the outbreak (Babvey et al., 2021) . This may also contribute to child maltreatment.",

One study showed that parental depression is a significant predictor of whether parents physically abused their children during the pandemic (Lawson et al., 2020) , while Wong et al. (2021) found that neither parental depression nor anxiety in pandemic are risk factors for child maltreatment. The reasons for this discrepancy need to be further explored. Although drug abuse has been consistently shown to be related to all forms of aggression and violence, including intimate partner violence (Cafferky et al., 2018) and child abuse (Stith et al., 2009) , however, how does it relate to Chinese children need to be further explored. Besides, a study conducted during the pandemic showed no correlation between parental education and child maltreatment (both physical abuse and emotional neglect) , which is inconsistent with previous findings (Wan et al., 2020) . Therefore, more studies are needed to verify their relationship.",

Secondly, considering the cities' sizes, 600 rural households were selected from Wuhan and 180 rural households per city were selected from the other five. A total of 1,500 eligible households were surveyed. Finally, one child was randomly selected from each household to answer the questionnaire. Before the survey, a pilot survey of twenty rural adolescents in Hubei province was conducted to identify ambiguity problems and to refine the format of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was then sent to eligible children by one experienced local interviewer using mobile communication. Informed consent was obtained from the children and their caregivers before they started the survey, and the children were told that they were allowed to withdraw from the survey at any time and skip any questions if they felt uncomfortable. Completing the questionnaire took about thirty minutes. This study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the research ethics committee of the first author's affiliate university.",

The proportions of Grade 7, 8 and 9 were 32.6, 33.9 and 33.5 percent, respectively. Nearly 85 percent of them had siblings and 3.9 percent reported that they came from a poor family. Their fathers were farm workers (53.0 percent), migrant workers (45.9 percent), unemployed due to physical disability (0.9 percent) or had passed away (0.2 percent). Table 1 presents the prevalence of the maltreatment of children during the lockdown period and before the lockdown. These results show that 13.9 percent of the participants witnessed family violence, 13.7 percent reported being subjected to physical violence, 20.2 percent experienced emotional abuse and 7.3 percent reported neglect during the lockdown period from 23 January 2020 to 8 April 2020. Regarding lifetime prevalence, 17.0 percent of the surveyed children reported witnessing family violence, 13.4 percent reported experiencing physical violence, 14.6 percent experienced emotional abuse and 6.9 percent reported neglect before the pandemic. A trend analysis showed that the prevalence of emotional violence during the lockdown period was much higher than that before the lockdown at p < 0.001 level. The prevalence of physical violence and neglect was similar to their lifetime experiences. The prevalence of family violence witness was lower during the lockdown period than that before the lockdown at p < 0.01 level.",

Children whose family members with drug abuse history (OR \u00bc 9.22, p < 0.01) and mental illness (OR \u00bc 5.50, p < 0.01) were more likely to report neglect than their counterparts. During their lifetime pre-lockdown, children having a better educated father were less likely to report witnessing family violence; however, children whose family members diagnosed with mental illness were more likely to report family violence witness (OR \u00bc 5.65, p < 0.01). Children from separate/divorced family were more likely to report physical violence (OR \u00bc 1.77, p < 0.05) than those from intact families. Children with better educated fathers were more likely to report emotional violence, and those having family members with drug abuse history were more likely to report neglect (OR \u00bc 6.33, p < 0.01) than their counterparts. Among the children who reported experiencing physical violence during the lockdown, only 0.7 percent reported that they were injured; 2.1 percent chose not to answer. Of the respondents, 69 percent knew that there were agencies that assist victims; however, only 1.4 percent once attempted to seek help. Further, only 14.5 percent of the victims of physical violence told someone else of their experience, as depicted in Table 3 . Table 4 presents the ORs of the four separate logistic regressions on self-harm behaviours after controlling for age and gender. During the pandemic, children who witnessed family violence were more than twice as likely to report self-harm behaviours, compared with those who did not witness family violence (OR \u00bc 2.65, p < 0.05). Children who reported physical violence were more than three times as likely to attempt self-harm, compared with those without such experience (OR \u00bc 3.55, p < 0.01). Children who reported emotional violence were more than twice as likely to deliberately harm themselves (OR \u00bc 2.59, p < 0.01) than those without emotional violence.

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic will generate unforeseen impact on children's health and well-being. Despite the lack of data directly measuring the relationship between pandemics and child maltreatment, previous research has provided evidence that the risk of child maltreatment is increased during or after large-scale disasters (Keenan et al., 2004; Seddighi et al., 2021) . This study is the first to report the prevalence of the maltreatment of children and the associated consequences during the pandemic in rural China, which is helpful to provide a reference for research and services on children's mental health during the epidemic. First, we found emotional abuse is the most prevalent type of abuse experienced by children in China during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is consistent with Connell and Strambler's (2021) study. A study conducted in children's emergency departments reported that the frequency of emotional abuse increased from 2.52 percent before the pandemic to 7 percent during the pandemic (Sharma and Borah, 2020) . The main reason for the high rate of emotional abuse is that confinement measures resulted in families spending more time together during the lockdown. School closures presented additional parenting burdens and the challenges of providing continuous care for children while working at home has likely precipitated heightened stress and anxiety (Coyne et al., 2020) . It is important to note that the lifetime prevalence of emotional abuse among Chinese children is higher than previous studies, and so is during the pandemic. More specifically, Finkelhor et al. (2013) showed that the lifetime rate of child maltreatment was 14.9 percent and Sharma and Borah (2020) found that the prevalence rate of emotional abuse was 7 percent during the pandemic. One plausible explanation is that worse education of rural Chinese parents in our sample may be associated with harsh parenting and emotional abuse (Yang et al., 2005) . Emotional abuse, as one of the most common and most easily overlooked forms of child abuse (Glaser, 2002) , has been shown to negatively affect children's development, including brain and cognitive development as well as social and emotional development (Kim and Cicchetti, 2010; Hong et al., 2018) . Therefore, strategies to draw parents' attention to emotional abuse are warranted. Single-parent families are at greater risk for emotionally abusing their children, which is consistent with previous research (Mulder et al., 2018; Wan and Luan, 2018; Wan et al., 2020) . Single-parent status was associated with poor parenting, or higher levels of parenting stress (Mullins et al., 2011; Charlotte et al., 2019) . This may have put children in a high-risk environment for possible emotional abuse during the lockdown period. However, emotional abuse was more prevalent among families with higher education fathers during their lifetime, which is consistent with traditional 'severe father and kind mother' parenting image in China.",

Boys were found to experience more physical violence, which is consistent with previous studies in China and in other countries (Gao et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2017; Wan et al., 2020) . The disparity in physical violence against boys and against girls may be attributed to gender-related behavioural characteristics (Cui et al., 2016) . Boys often demonstrate more aggressive and delinquent behaviour (Xing et al., 2011) , which may be regarded as misconduct that disturbs interpersonal harmony or being unfilial to their parents; this, in turn, leads to parents being more likely to practice corporal punishment on them (Qiao and Xie, 2017) . In addition, the male gender stereotype endorses a 'stronger character' under artificial gender cognition in Confucian society; therefore, punishment for boys may be considered as preparation for their roles in adulthood (Antai et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2020) . However, inconsistent with our study, studies conducted in American during the pandemic found that gender was not a predictor of physical violence (Lawson et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) . This diversity may be due to differences in the characteristics of sample and differences in reporters. During the lifetime span before the lockdown, children from single-parent family tended to report higher physical violence, which is similar to previous findings (Wan et al., 2020) .",

Parents with drug abuse history and mental illness were less capable of caring for their children, therefore failing to meet the children's immediate needs (Roscoe et al., 2018) . During the lockdown period, parents with drug abuse history and existing mental illness may experience a worsening of their mental health due to a lack of social support and professional help, which may lead to child neglect. Parental drug abuse history and mental illness were also risk factors for neglect and family violence witness before the lockdown. Father's education was a protective factor for domestic violence, which is also consistent with previous studies (Emre et al., 2006; Jahromi et al., 2015) ; however, it became non-significant during the lockdown period.

This phenomenon may be linked to Chinese characteristics regarding the disclosure of family violence or abuse. For Chinese people, family honour and pride or \"saving face\" are top priorities. Considering that in Chinese culture, family abuse is shameful, the victims may more likely prohibit disclosure of violence and help-seeking behaviour from social services (Chan, 2011; Kuo and Kavanagh, 1994; Yick et al., 2003) . Furthermore, professional help is not always available and helpful to them, especially during the lockdown period. One study revealed that there are barriers to the police service addressing domestic violence and saving children who are exposed to danger (Saxton et al., 2020) , as the police lack the necessary knowledge and resources to provide help to those who are subject to violence. On the contrary, help-seeking behaviour from children may irritate the perpetrators, leading to more abuse. In the meanwhile, because of lockdown, many child and youth welfare workers were no longer available, because they had to take care of their own children at home (United Service Trade Union, 2020); thus, the help-seeking resources were greatly reduced.",

Social vulnerability emphasises that human beings can improve their ability to cope with injury by modifying or changing their own characteristics and behaviours (Cutter, 1996) . Tian et al. (2020) found that there was a significant correlation between children's resilience and self-harm, which could explain the negative effects of the pandemic on children's self-harm behaviours. It reminds us that we should strengthen the early identification and intervention of self-harm and suicide behaviour of children who have experienced abuse and improve their resilience.",

First, this was a retrospective survey that required children to recall their experiences of violence before and during the COVID-19 pandemic; it inevitably involves recall bias, which may influence the validity of our survey. Multiple data sources should be adopted to reduce bias in the future. Secondly, all the measures were based on self-reporting from children at one point in time, which may involve common method variance and is subject to social desirability. Future studies should consider using a longitudinal design to explore changes in the prevalence, risk factors and consequences of violence towards children, especially during major public health emergencies. Thirdly, the measures for help-seeking behaviours were rather general and the exact reasons for children not seeking help during different types of violence remain unknown. This information could help mental health professionals and social workers to design prevention and intervention programmes in future.",

Results show that: (1) emotional abuse is the most prevalent type of abuse experienced by children in China during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) boys, rural children living in single-parent families, those having family members with a history of drug abuse and mental illness are at greater risk of maltreatment; (3) most of victims did not seek official help; and (4) all types of child maltreatment were positively associated with self-harm behaviours. These findings could be of great value in advising social workers to establish and implement early identification and intervention programmes in rural China, encouraging children who experience maltreatment to receive timely services during the COVID-2019 pandemic. In addition, promotion and training programmes to encourage help-seeking behaviours should be designed and implemented in rural schools by social workers and health professionals. Finally, a more fundamental and flexible child protection system should be established in rural China to promote the well-being of disadvantaged children, especially during a public health emergency.",
