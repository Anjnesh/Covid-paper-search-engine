Methodology In this prospective single centre study, consecutive patients diagnosed with RTPCR confirmed COVID 19 were included after 4-6 weeks of discharge from hospital. All patients underwent level I PSG. EEG was analysed for presence of abnormal EEG pattern. Results Total 189 patients were contacted telephonically for participation in this study. Finally 81 patients (55 males, 26 females) underwent Level I PSG. Total sleep time was 345.1 \u00b1 85.1 min. Sleep efficiency was 76.0 \u00b1 14.2%. Mean time (%) during N1, N2, N3 and Rapid Eye movement (REM) was 16.4%, 59.2%, 7.9% and 18.4% percentage, respectively. Mean AHI was 28.7 \u00b1 22.8 per hour and arousal index was 23.9 \u00b1 13.3. Alpha intrusion was the most common EEG finding (78%), followed by cyclical alternating pattern (59%). REM density was significantly increased in 38% of patients. REM alpha bursts and increased spindles were also seen in 27% and 16%. Conclusion Abnormal EEG waves are very commonly seen in COVID-19 survivors. Presence of these abnormal PSG-EEG waves hints that COVID-19 might have similar effects as depression, insomnia on these subjects, at least in short run. Whether these changes are temporary or permanent needs to be evaluated by performing serial polysomnographies in patients with COVID-19 ARDS.",

It is thought to translate a state of arousal instability involving muscle, behavioural, and autonomic functions. During NREM sleep, cyclic alternating pattern is organized in sequences. A cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) sequence is composed of succession of cyclic alternating pattern cycles. A CAP cycle is composed of phase A (lumps of sleep phasic events) followed by phase B (return to EEG background). All CAP sequences begin with a phase A and end with a phase B. Each phase of cyclic alternating pattern is 2-60 s in duration. Cyclic alternating pattern sequences commonly precede the transition from non-REM to REM sleep and end just before REM sleep onset [13] . CAP is considered to be the main expression of sleep Several studies have shown that sleep disorders such as OSA, PLM, and insomnia have increased CAP measures [14] [15] [16] .",
