The pathogenesis of VILI is based on increased permeability of the alveolar capillary membrane, which is associated with reduced or inactivated pulmonary surfactant and increased alveolar permeability and inflammation [4] [5] [6] .

This study demonstrated that high tidal volume mechanical ventilation caused lung injury as assessed by lung injury scores, W/D weight ratio, Evans blue dye extravasation, and HE staining. The mechanisms herein assessed include activation of inflammatory responses; barrier function damage and changes in sodium, potassium, and calcium plasma channels. This study sought to investigate the mechanisms regulating barrier function. treated with or without si-MMP-9. Immunofluorescence analysis evidenced that intracellular E-cadherin and occludin were observed in mice treated with si-Elk1 or The alveolar epithelial barrier plays an important role in lung barrier function since it maintains lung tissue homeostasis, participates in pathogen defense, and regulates immune responses [26, 27] . Tight junctions are an integral part of the lung barrier. occludin and E-cadherin are typical proteins of tight junctions. Thus, we used occludin and E-cadherin as indicatives of the alveolar epithelial barrier. In this study, we showed that high tidal volume mechanical ventilation and 20% cyclic stretch could decrease the expressions of E-cadherin and occludin, thus damaging the alveolar epithelial barrier function in a time-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with previous studies. However, underlying mechanisms should be further investigated.",

Several recent studies have found that MMP-9 is involved in the expressions of E-cadherin or occludin in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, acute lung injury, and acute kidney injury [29] [30] [31] . Thus, we investigated if MMP-9 could regulate tight junctions in VILI. TIMP-1 is an MMP9-specific tissue inhibitor, which combines with MMP-9 in a 1:1 ratio [17] . The proportion of MMP-9/ TIMP-1 may affect synthesis and degradation of E-cadherin or occludin, which maintains barrier function [32] . The high ratio of MMP-9/TIMP-1 destroyed the lung tissue structure [18] . Our study showed that the high ratio of MMP-9/TIMP-1 decreased E-cadherin and occludin in VILI in vivo. MMP-9 knockdown decreased the ratio of MMP-9/TIMP-1 and reversed the expressions of E-cadherin and occludin to alleviate the lung structure in VILI.
