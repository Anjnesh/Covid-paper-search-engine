The authorities' response to the plague resonates with approaches to coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19): they isolate the town from the outside, and within the town isolate the infected to prevent spread. The Plague presents the experiences, responses, and traumas of people in many life situations, including the trauma when authorities remove infected family members from the household and take them to the sequestered building for those infected on the margins of town. It describes the pain for parents when they are separated from their children. It follows the trajectory of several older men who are infected-and some who escape infection even while wishing for it. Camus points out the economic distress of those who are poor when scarce food becomes costly, compared with the layers of protection for those better connected and resourced. Notably, there is little focus on the older population and no attention to older women, and it spends little time on what it means for an older person to be locked away in their last years, separated from those they love and who love them.",

The public health responses to COVID-19 also have deep parallels with Oran, obviously including containing the spread of disease by isolating the infected, quarantining the exposed, secluding the vulnerable, and preventing travel. We have many additional advantages now: scientific advances and capabilities; effective public health expertise in pandemic prevention and response; a recognition that clear, transparent, and aligned leadership and communication is essential; and an understanding of the use of physical distancing to minimize risk of spread, which combined with better face coverings and sanitizing together constitute an effective \"non-pharmacologic vaccine.\" Now, we have a pharmacologic vaccine which adds essential protection. However, the fact remains that with regard to COVID-19, it appears we have not progressed as much as one would have hoped from Oran's prevention methods, with significant mismatches between longstanding approaches and the current realities of this 2020-2021 pandemic.",

The USA, and the world, have demographically and epidemiologically different populations now: we are substantially older and with high rates of chronic diseases and obesity ( Table 1) . In this pandemic, those with obesity, multimorbidity, disability, and frailty, in particular, have shown high vulnerability to severe illness and death from COVID-19. In addition, while the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic found young adults-especially those in military barracks-most vulnerable, the most vulnerable in 2020-2021 have been older adults, medical care providers, those in close quarters in nursing homes-residents or staff-or prisons or meatpacking plants, and those with pre-existing health conditions at any age. People of color, both older and middle aged, have been particularly at risk due to the cumulative effects of systemic disadvantage, racism, and disparities. The USA's responses to containing the pandemic itself have not been as successful as they could be, because of lack of empowerment of science-based public health leadership and a public health system long starved of resources, workforce, and political support of its import (1), exacerbated by a primary focus on mitigating medical care needs without adequate prevention. We have not been prepared to target protection to people with pre-existing chronic disease, in congregate living situations, and other risk groups. Furthermore, current approaches have resulted in extreme social isolation for many older people; the latter, in particular, is inhumane and requires new approaches.",

            "text": "To be effective for our twenty-first century reality, we need to modernize public health approaches so as to prevent both infection and severe isolation and other unintended consequences of infection-only responses to COVID-19. The long-term underinvestment in public health has revealed needs for modernized and integrated public health-led disease surveillance, and a trained and adequate public health workforce who can mount rapid and sufficient responses of contact tracing and testing. We need to develop approaches that recognize the most vulnerable and meet their needs in order to decrease risks of both infection and precarity. The pandemic has shown us threats to well-being at every level of Maslow's hierarchy of essential human needs (9) , and particularly so for older adults and those with the cumulative effects of health disparities and with few resources, including precariousness of access to food, shelter, security, employment, and other resources. Furthermore, those at high risk are often living in multigenerational households with no available place to self-isolate. Additionally, the human need for connection has been severely threatened. Fifty-six percent of older adults have felt isolated from others, and 46% had infrequent social contact, twice the level of 2 years previously. Overall, rates of loneliness have been quite high in the pandemic, and especially so for those who are essentially living in a prolonged state of solitary confinement, whether homebound or in an institution. Those older adults experiencing loneliness are more likely to be women, to be living alone, unemployed, disabled or not working, or with incomes <$60,000 a year (10). Loneliness risk in this pandemic appears to be compounded by a pre-existing thinning, over the last half century, of social infrastructure and institutions that support social capital and positive connection and cohesion in a community (11) . A sense of being a visible and valued member of a community-belonging, self-esteem, and self-actualization in the language of Maslowhas been further threatened by the pandemic-related rise in ageism, with public narratives that have both blamed older people for the severe impact of the pandemic and further devalued older people by proposing that they remain in seclusion so \"productive\" individuals (per the narrative) can get back to work. Little is said about the evidence that health and the economy are not separable, nor about the human rights and value of older people, or even to value older adults' accepting prolonged isolation in order to protect not just themselves from getting infected, but, altruistically, to keep others safe.",

By definition, public goods require governmental investment since there is no profit to be made by any sector, while all benefit and none are excluded.

(2) Local public health departments, as community health strategists, need to promote and create policies that provide social protections during emergencies (i.e., eviction protections, access to food) in collaboration with other governmental entities (14) . We should start by seizing this moment to do the research to understand where older people and all at risk were well-served, and the needs that should be met. (3) The suspension of many community-based services left vulnerable older adults without food or meal deliveries, aides to take them to medical appointments, and visitors to bring services and counter loneliness and isolation. In the absence of these, precarity has risen, while other health problems have not been attended to. Working jointly with local agencies on aging and other community groups, public health departments should develop infection prevention regulations and guidelines for community organizations so that they can safely continue to care for and support homebound older adults, while also enabling continued in-home care by family members. (4) Multigenerational households with few resources are at high risk for infection in a pandemic and require targeted approaches to offer quarantine to those exposed and isolation and care to those infected outside of their household, while supporting connection to loved ones. (5) Furthermore, we need to develop population-level and community-based programmatic approaches to prevent the solitary confinement and loneliness arising from a pandemic with both acute responses and guidelines and long-term sustainable approaches (16, 17) . This includes work, as led by the Hartford Foundation, to promote transition to models of smaller units of community-based long-term care, and smaller \"pods\" that would better prevent infection of residents and staff while maintaining interaction during the next pandemic (16) . We could also develop roles, especially online, for community-dwelling older adults to support the well-being of their community during a pandemic or other emergency. These would counter the inaccurate ageist tropes that devalue older adults, while enabling solutions for social belonging, purpose, and impact for older people, essential to well-being. Roles could range from community education about how to protect oneself and each other from infection, to identifying neighbors in need, to community service of organizing food or meals for those in the building or neighborhood unable to get it, to online reading groups for younger children or online choral groups, and much more. This would require assuring Internet connectivity for all (see below).",

A third approach would be to recognize the critical import of Internet connectivity in today's world, and that many older adults live without that vital connectivity. Despite Internet access's centrality to life in the USA, the FCC's 2019 Broadband Deployment report noted that 21.3 million people in the USA lack access to broadband Internet; outside researchers estimate the number to be closer to 42 million (18) .
