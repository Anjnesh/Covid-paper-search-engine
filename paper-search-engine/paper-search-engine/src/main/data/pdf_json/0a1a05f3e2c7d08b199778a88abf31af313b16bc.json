            "text": "Pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 and is strongly associated with poor disease outcomes. However, SARS-CoV-2 infection can also trigger de novo acute and chronic cardiovascular disease. Acute cardiac complications include arrhythmia, myocarditis and heart failure, which are significantly associated with higher in-hospital mortality. The possible mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes this acute cardiac disease include direct damage caused by viral invasion of cardiomyocytes as well as indirect damage through systemic inflammation. The long-term cardiac complications associated with COVID-19 are incompletely characterised and thought to include hypertension, arrhythmia, coronary atherosclerosis and heart failure. Although some cardiac-related symptoms can last over 6 months, the effect of these complications on long-term patient health remains unclear. The risk factors associated with long-term cardiovascular disease remain poorly defined. Determining which patients are most at-risk of long-term cardiovascular disease is vital so that targeted follow-up and patient care can be provided. The aim of this review was to summarise the current evidence of the acute and long-term cardiovascular consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 may cause cardiovascular disease.",

SARS-CoV-2 causes a broad range of respiratory symptoms, ranging from subclinical disease to viral pneumonia. 1 Despite the recent availability of vaccines, approximately 500 000 individuals are still infected daily with SARS-CoV-2. It is increasingly apparent that like other severe respiratory virus infections, SARS-CoV-2 causes a variety of extra-respiratory complications. 1, 2 Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism and other de novo cardiovascular complications.

In addition to binding to ACE-2, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 must be cleaved at the S1/S2 boundary. 9 This cleavage can be effected by host cell surface proteases, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B/L, which then primes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for entry. 10 Additional cleavage by furin produces a sequence motif that binds to cell surface neuropilin-1, which enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. 11 In vivo SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets epithelial cells within the respiratory tract, including type 2 pneumocytes in the lower respiratory tract. Whilst initial studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could also infect endothelial cells, 12 this has recently been called into question. 13 Central to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the induction of a dysregulated pro-inflammatory response referred to as a cytokine storm. It is thought that this cytokine storm, and associated immunopathology, plays a significant role in both primary viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome that is characteristic of severe COVID-19. 14 Cardiovascular disease in acute COVID-19",

However, in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic there was significant concern that the use of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) for either de novo or preexisting cardiovascular disease would increase COVID-19 severity. This was based on the suggestion that ACEi/ARB can increase the level of ACE-2 and thereby facilitate increased SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, when limited to a hypertensive subgroup, a recent meta-analysis showed a significant association between reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition and reduced risk of death. 30 This most likely reflects the vasodilation and anti-inflammatory effects associated with increased ACE-2 expression, which acts to counterbalance the renin-angiotensin system by degrading angiotensin II. 31, 32 However, this mechanism of action remains speculative and the exact role of RAAS inhibition in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be defined.",

[33] [34] [35] [36] In contrast, human pluripotent stem cell-derived smooth muscle cells are refractory to infection. 34 SARS-CoV-2 infection of hPSC-CMs results in cessation of beating, 33 cell death, 34, 36 impaired electrophysiological function, 34 transcriptional and morphological signatures of damage 35 and impaired contractile function, 34, 36 all of which may contribute to cardiovascular disease in vivo. However, the in vivo evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the heart remains equivocal. In autopsy and endomyocardial biopsy specimens from 4 COVID-19 patients, viral protein was detected by immunostaining in cardiomyocytes but not cardiac macrophages, fibroblasts or endothelial cells. 36 Similarly, in autopsies of 39 patients with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the myocardium of 24 patients, whilst negative sense RNA (indicative of active viral replication) was only detected in the myocardium of the 5 patients with the highest virus load. 37 An autopsy study of a further 41 patients showed that whilst SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in the hearts of a large number of patients (n = 30), SARS-CoV-2 + cells in the myocardium were rare. 38 In contrast to these findings, amongst autopsy specimens from five COVID-19 patients no viral antigens could be detected in the heart, although all patients displayed severe myofibrillar anomalies. 35 Similarly, in 8 COVID-19 autopsies SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in the heart of any patient by in situ hybridisation, immunohistochemistry or qRT-PCR. 39 Therefore, the contribution of direct viral infection of cardiomyocytes to in vivo pathogenesis remains unclear.",

            "text": "When considering the consequences of direct viral infection of the heart, it is important to recognise that the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE-2, plays an integral role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In the RAS signalling pathway, ACE and ACE-2 play opposing roles. On the one hand, ACE converts Ang I to Ang II in order to induce vasoconstrictive, pro-oxidative and proinflammatory effects. 31, 32, 40 On the other hand, Figure 1 . Schematic representation of the putative mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes cardiovascular disease. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE-2 in myocardium (1) to enter the target cell. This causes downregulation of ACE-2, which converts vasoconstricting/inflammatory angiotensin II into vasodilating/anti-inflammatory protein angiotensin 1-7. The concentration of angiotensin 1-7 decreases and that of angiotensin II increases, contributing to reduced coronary artery flow, myocardial ischaemia (2) and inflammation. Increased angiotensin II also cause vasoconstriction at the alveolar-capillary bed, leading specific increased strain on a right heart that is already struggling because of the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and micro vascular thromboses. 52 Cell injury such as myocardial fibrosis (3) and apoptosis (4) is caused by both direct viral involvement and systemic inflammation from an imbalance of T helper 1 and 2 responses, denoted by elevated serum cytokines (5), 5 facilitating long-term disease including arrhythmias (6) and hypercoagulability. Increased cardiometabolic demand leads to a reduced cardiac reserve, denoted by compensative left ventricular hypertrophy (7), further contributing to angiotensin-aldosterone system dysregulation. Therapies used during the acute phase of infection, such as high-dose steroid treatment, may increase plaque formation (8) and hypertension and decrease cardiac function. High-dose steroid also could work as a stress hormone, inducing excess catecholamine, leading to excess oxygen consumption of myocardium and decrease cardiac function. 53 Cardiac injury results in elevated cardiac troponin (CTN) and NT-pro BNP levels (5).

ACE-2 degrades Ang II to Ang (1-7) resulting in the prevention of hypertension, fibrosis, inflammation, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 41 SARS-CoV-2 binds and internalises ACE-2 upon infection contributing to an increase in Ang II levels and, as a result, an increase in Ang II-induced biological effects, making COVID-19 patients more susceptible to cardiovascular diseases. 27 This dysregulation of the RAS may occur in conjunction with virus-induced cardiovascular damage and systemic inflammation, the combination of which may increase the development of de novo cardiovascular complications. Indeed, the role of ACE-2 in both viral replication and RAS may explain why SARS-CoV-2 induces a higher rate of cardiac complications than other pneumonia-inducing viral infections (which do not bind to ACE-2) such as seasonal influenza virus. 42, 43 SARS-CoV-2 infection also induces a systemic inflammatory response, which may contribute to myocardial injury. 5 Detection of SARS-CoV-2 pathogen association molecular patterns (PAMPS) and",

Whilst serving to reduce viral replication and spread, a dysregulated proinflammatory response or 'cytokine storm' will itself culminate in tissue damage by attracting more cytokine-secreting cells to the lung and triggering epithelial cell apoptosis/necrosis. This pulmonary inflammatory response is further perpetuated in the vasculature where endothelial cells, although not directly infected with SARS-CoV-2, sense the viral infection in the adjacent epithelial cells and mount an inflammatory response. 13 The local and systemic cytokine profile during COVID-19 includes IL-6, IL-10, IL-1b, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), IFNs (IFN-a/b, IFN-c) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10). 5, 44 This cytokine storm can cause acute cardiac injury through a variety of different mechanisms. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6 have a negative inotropic effect on cardiac contractility. 23 Furthermore, TNFa-induced continuous activation of inflammatory signalling can cause widespread cardiomyocyte apoptosis, leading to pathological remodelling of the left ventricle and, ultimately, acute heart failure. 23 Alternatively, in particular amongst patients with underlying comorbidities, inflammation may trigger cardiovascular disease by triggering the rupture of the coronary atherosclerotic plaques. 45 Finally, this inflammatory response may not be independent of viral infection of the heart. SARS-CoV-2 infection of the heart would not only augment cardiovascular inflammation, but the resultant downregulation of ACE-2 would also serve to further perpetuate the inflammatory response. 27, 46, 47 In addition to systemic inflammation, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 indirectly contributes to cardiovascular disease via the induction of respiratory distress, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic hypoxia, with resultant hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. 48 Long-term hypoxia causes myocardial cell injuries and necrosis, as well as cardiac arrhythmias. 4, 49, 50 Specifically, cardiomyocytes undergo cell membrane destruction as a result of intracellular acidosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production caused by decreased blood oxygen and energy supply (hypoxemia). 51 Hypoxemia also induces an influx of calcium ions, which contributes to cardiomyocyte injury and apoptosis. 51 Alternatively, it is possible that viral pneumonia and the often-associated pulmonary thromboembolisms result in RV abnormalities.",

Amongst 100 convalescent COVID-19 patients (follow-up time > 2 weeks post-symptom onset), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed that 78% of patients had cardiac involvement and 60% had ongoing myocardial inflammation. 67 Strikingly, the presence of cardiovascular disease was independent of time from the original diagnosis, pre-existing conditions and the severity and course of the acute illness, raising concerns that cardiovascular disease may emerge in patients who only experienced mild or even asymptomatic COVID-19. 67 Consistent with this notion, amongst 26 competitive college athletes who had recovered from mild COVID-19 (11-53 days postsymptom onset) four athletes had CMR findings consistent with myocarditis, whilst 12 athletes had LGE. 68 In contrast to these findings, no significant long-term cardiovascular complications were recorded in healthcare workers (n = 74) 6 months following a mild COVID-19 infection. 69 Specifically, compared with seronegative healthcare workers there was no significant changes in cardiac structure, function, tissue characterisation or biomarkers of individuals with a history of COVID-19 infection.",

Elevated cytokine levels have been detected in the sera of convalescent COVID-19 patients, including elevated levels of pro-angiogenic MIP-1b, BDNF and VEGF. 70, 71 Whether this is sufficient to drive cardiovascular dysfunction, or is indicative of other underlying inflammation that then plays a causative role in cardiovascular disease, remains to be determined. Alternatively, it is possible that therapies used during the acute phase of illness (such as high-dose steroid treatment) have longterm consequences, as was previously observed with SARS-CoV-1. 72, 73 However, such a hypothesis would fail to explain the incidence of cardiovascular disease in convalescent individuals who had mild COVID-19. Recovered COVID-19 patients may have increased cardiometabolic demand, as previously described in SARS-CoV-1 survivors, resulting in reduced cardiac reserve and dysregulation of the angiotensin-aldosterone system. 8 Myocardial fibrosis or scarring (resulting from the acute inflammatory response or viral infection) may also facilitate long-term disease, including re-entrant arrhythmias. 8 The current clinical consensus is not to advise the routine use of advanced cardiac imaging in convalescent COVID-19 patients. It is vital that research in this field continues to define which patients are most at-risk of long-term cardiovascular disease so that targeted cardiovascular follow-up can be performed.",

Acute cardiac complications include arrhythmia, myocarditis and heart failure. Direct myocardial injuries can be caused by the invasion of the virus itself in patients with underlying comorbidities. Indirect myocardial injuries can be caused by systemic inflammation because of the cytokine storm, causing a negative inotropic effect on cardiac contractility, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and acute heart failure. Long-term cardiac complications include hypertension, arrhythmia, coronary atherosclerosis and heart failure. As the mechanism of long-term complications, hypoxia, cytokines, increased cardiac metabolism and myocardial fibrosis might be related.
