However, considering public attitudes on tidal energy are not well known, especially in developing countries, a barrier exists in implementing public engagement strategies.

Furthermore, use of renewable energy technologies contributes to climate change mitigation and disaster risk reduction, as highlighted in Goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that promotes affordable and clean energy by all the member states of United Nations. According to the latest data about the progress towards SDG 7, stepped-up efforts towards all targets were urgently required if SDG 7 should be reached within the coming decade [2] . Tidal current energy is a new technology that can provide clean renewable energy and contribute to successfully attaining SDG 7. Tidal current energy can be considered superior to other renewable energy sources such as wave power or wind power, as it is less susceptible to severe weather events such as typhoons or storms and, compared to those sources, tidal currents are a regular and predictable source of energy [3, 4] . With several tidal projects under development in various parts of the world [5] there is an urgent need to address certain research areas. While there are many studies focusing on the technological [6] [7] [8] [9] , environmental [10, 11] , and economic [10, [12] [13] [14] [15] aspects of tidal energy, there are only a few studies dealing with the social aspects [16] . This is expected as tidal technology is relatively new and has not yet been implemented commercially leading to relatively scarce information about, especially among the general public.",

Strategies focusing on consultation processes, whereby the public is formally allowed to voice their opinion, can only be effective if the public is sufficiently and correctly informed of all the related aspects of tidal energy, as it has been found that the public can form opinions inconsistent with prior scientific studies in case of offshore renewable energy [19] . Likewise, the engagement methods, when the public is involved in each stage of development, are bound to failure without adequately knowledgeable members. Providing information about benefits and disadvantages of the project at an early stage allows people time to think about the issues, consider implications, and formulate their views. An informed public will understand the trade-offs, be able to contribute meaningfully to project design, and have greater trust with the project proponent [20] .",

ABS, an ideal methodology to replicate social systems, is used in this study to simulate the flow of information in a remote local community in a developing country to increase support for tidal energy, reflecting the unique nature of their society, and the type of information that is preferable to them. The key factors affecting the information flow and the ideal strategies for information provision that can be used by the developers to increase support for tidal energy are explored in this study. The subsequent sections describe the study area, followed by explanation of the methods used for this study.

There are many areas in developing countries such as Indonesia, where there is tremendous potential for tidal energy [24, 25] . Moreover, many areas with potential for tidal energy generation lie in remote locations, such as isolated islands. Larantuka strait in Flores Timur, a far-flung regency in Nusa Tenggarah Timur province in south-east Indonesia is one of the most favourable locations for tidal energy generation. Larantuka Strait is about 8 km in length. The north and south inlets of Larantuka Strait are both around 4.5 km wide. Meanwhile, at the narrowest part, the width of the strait is approximately 600 m and the depth is 20 m [26] . These conditions provide Larantuka strait with high potential for tidal energy generation [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . While Larantuka strait is the potential site of the tidal energy project, entire Flores Timur Regency is selected as the study area, as its population will be the major direct beneficiary of the project. This study adds on to the previous study by Ramachandran et al. [21] examining the public acceptance of tidal energy in Flores Timur Regency.",

The social stratification in Flores Timur, with an active traditional structure, is highly prominent. The leaders of Koten, Kelen, Hurint and Maran clans maintain a revered place at the top of the hierarchy, followed by leaders of other clans and village elders [21] . Not only are the social structures made of at least four hierarchical levels, the governmental administrative bodies as well as the prominent religious institutions also display a hierarchical nature, with four or more stratifications. Based on interviews with the local community members and local government officials, it was identified that the social structure of the community is significant for all communications, as the information flow follows the top-down hierarchy [21] . This study considers the population of Flores Timur Regency, with its hierarchical society in replicating the flow of information, in relation to tidal energy development. The study also considers two types of information that may impact the public view on tidal energy. Statistical results of Ramachandran et al. [21] show that the local people in Flores Timur Regency tend to show more support for tidal energy if their preference is for information related to individual benefits of tidal energy, as opposed to the information about collective benefits of tidal energy.",

Normally, multinomial probit modelling uses the average response values of the variables of the entire sample to estimate the predicted probabilities. However, the social hierarchies consisting of four hierarchical groups that are observed in the society in Flores Timur have to be replicated within the ABS model with each hierarchical group having separate input values for each variable rather than the overall mean value of the entire sample.

This model follows the approach similar to those employed by Wilensky [47] and Huang et al. [48] for their models. In this simulation model, the agents exist in a two-dimensional space, consisting of 2500 cells or patches, with an agent occupying each cell, with the proximity of two agents representing geographical distance. According to Allen [49] , the physical proximity has an indirect relationship on the probability of agents communicating, and this is reflected in the model where agents who are close together are more likely to interact. The model uses spatial proximity, defined here as 'visibility range' to determine the vicinity where a given individual can seek information from or spread it to other agents. The results of the model simulations show the fastest and the most efficient way to spread information in the local community.",

In this study, it is implemented by confirming that the simulation model is correctly coded, and the program performs as anticipated from the perspective of findings in the field. One of the key methods employed here for verification is tracing-a form of testing that comprises receiving all intermediate outputs from a computer program automatically, and then comparing it with manually calculated results [54] . To verify that the sharing and harvesting behaviours were working as anticipated, the attribute data for singular patches and agents were inspected, cycle-by-cycle, as the simulation proceeded under specially created test scenarios for which the correct behaviour was already known, and outputs were calculated manually. For these simulation experiments, the intermediate simulation outputs matched the manual calculations, thus supporting the verification of the model.",

Before any simulation model can be used to replicate a phenomenon in a society, it is important to validate the model for that community to ensure that the model is an accurate representation of the real-world system under study [53] . For this ABS model, primary data on the input parameters was collected using questionnaire survey, expert interviews, and field observations to identify the behaviours exhibited by different groups of individuals in the community [21] . Additionally, secondary sources such as the census data [55] , is also employed to define the input parameters for the simulation. Moreover, regression analyses and other statistical measures as described earlier are employed to ensure the viability of the input parameters to replicate the actual situation of the case study area, as well as their use in the ABS. The validation of the simulation model can be accomplished by comparing the simulation outputs with the actual observations from the community.",

Moreover, the education level also changed with the hierarchies, whereby the individuals belonging to the higher hierarchical groups tended to be more educated compared to others. Additionally, the more experienced stakeholders belonged to the higher hierarchical groups. This is reflected in the input parameters where values for age are set at 6, 5, 3, and 3 for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, and values for education are set at 6, 4, 3, and 2 for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Based on further interviews and field observations, additional information was collected qualitatively to reflect the local situation in Flores Timur Regency, and is used to set up the remaining parameters for ABS. The harvesting, receiving, and sharing rates for i-info are set 0.05 more than c-info. The harvesting rates for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, are set at 0.65, 0.65, 0.45, and 0.25, respectively, for c-info and 0.7, 0.7, 0.5, and 0.3, respectively, for i-info. The receiving rates for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, are set at 0.75, 0.75, 0.55, and 0.35, respectively, for c-info and 0.8, 0.8, 0.6, and 0.4, respectively, for i-info. The sharing rate is set at 0.7 for c-info and 0.75 for i-info. The influence of each group also differs by 0.1 with values set at 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7 for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4. Finally, the information-spread rate between cells is fixed at 0.5. This study assumes the above parameters and the assigned values reflect the situation in Flores Timur Regency accurately. Description of all the parameters used and their given values can be found in Additional file 1: Appendix S1. The principle idea behind the base model is to replicate the flow of information as observed in a community like Flores Timur, where the information originates from the top level and spreads hierarchically, with the top level acquiring the information at the fastest rate compared to other groups. Additionally, the results of the simulation which enable us to identify strategies can help the project developers in implementing their information provision strategies by testing the impact of making additional information available from the environment, the influence of delayed involvement of agents from some hierarchical levels, and the effect of change in the number of agents in certain hierarchical levels.",

However, few studies have explored information dissemination strategies for increasing support of renewable energy technologies. In this context, this study highlights vital strategies that can lead to increase in support for tidal energy by identifying the key factors that affect the flow of information in a local community. Information dissemination activities can be more efficient when the type of information that is more effective locally is diffused in the community. As the results from the post-estimation ROC curve indicate, individual outcome favourability is the most significant variable in driving support for tidal energy. Accordingly, as ABS shows i-info spreads faster through all hierarchical groups compared to c-info, the developers should focus more on disseminating information that focuses on benefits of tidal energy that specifically cater to the individual, as opposed to the information that concentrates on community benefits. For example, the developers should focus more on disseminating information related to additional jobs that benefit individuals, compared to the information about infrastructure development, which supports the whole community.",

Table 9a shows the number of cycles needed to spread information to the probable supporters of tidal energy. With additional information available, information takes 25-29 cycles less on average compared to the base model to be absorbed by probable supporters of tidal energy. The developers should focus on getting as much information as possible available to the public by not only relying on mouth-to-mouth communication, but also by employing traditional promotional methods such as newspaper and television advertisements, or employing more modern approaches such as promotions through social media applications that are becoming increasingly popular in Flores Timur. Additionally, during discussions with the local government officers as well as members of the general public, it emerged that the locals currently the locals use the television most frequently for acquiring information, and so the developers should consider using local television as a method to provide additional information to the public to achieve maximum impact.",

Developers can strategize on how they conduct their socialization sessions or who to focus their advertisements on. The results also show that there is low impact on the information flow when the lower hierarchy agents are introduced in the information flow only at later stages. In practice, the developers can design their promotional activities separately for the higher hierarchical groups, who can be targeted earlier, compared to the lower hierarchical groups who make up the bulk of the population and can be included later. For instance, the developers can hold the socialization sessions with only the most influential local stakeholders in the initial stages, thereby make savings Table 9 Number of cycles to spread information to probable supporters of tidal energy with (a) high information availability due to 90% information spread rate and (b) higher education values when every agent has at least high school education in terms of cost, time, and effort that may otherwise be spent on mass promotional activities. This strategy is not only significant to realize the savings, but also extremely important if one considers the current practices in Indonesia where the local population looks to the influential figures known as 'tokoh masyarakat', such as prominent politicians or religious leaders, for advice on all matters of public importance. In recent years, 'tokoh masyarakat' have been effective in informing the public on the ways to fight against the Covid-19 pandemic using their knowledge and attitudes [56] . In a similar manner, 'tokoh masyarakat' can be provided with complex information such as scientific data from environmental agencies or fishery departments highlighting the benefits to the farmers and fishermen. They can then use their knowledge, influence, and leadership to disseminate the information in a simplified way that everyone can understand, and hence educate the society as well as increase the support for tidal energy.",

The effectiveness of the information flow is highest when the community is well educated, and adds on to the point made by the head of the non-formal education in Flores Timur who emphasized the role of education in the development of Flores Timur Regency. In Flores Timur only 11.38% of the population have a high school diploma, with only 3.31% having college level education. Strikingly however, 32.15% of those aged over 10 years, have not graduated from any institution providing formal education [55] . Figure 7b shows the information growth for all hierarchical groups when all the agents possess high school education or more. Table 9b shows the number of cycles to spread information efficiently to the probable supporters of tidal energy when all the agents have at least high school level education. As displayed in Table 9b , information takes 13-16 cycles less on average to be absorbed by probable supporters of tidal energy. While this is an ideal scenario and may take many years to implement successfully, it shows excellent results in making information flow faster and more efficient, especially for the masses belonging to the lowest hierarchical group 4 who take 40-49 cycles less on average under all the three cases.",

This study based on agent-based simulation not only addresses the lack of studies for tidal energy in developing countries, but it does so from the perspective of project developers, while proposing pathways for information provision strategies necessary to sustainably deploy tidal energy projects. Additionally, the short, medium, and long-term strategies outlined in this study contribute toward achievement of multiple SDGs.",

First, this simulation focuses on mouth-to-mouth information flow between the agents and the impact of increasing availability of communication technologies has not been captured. Arguably, the use of modern social media communication applications may have a significant impact on the flow of information, which is not specifically addressed in the model. Second, this model assumes the initial information level to be equal for all the agents, while in practical terms, the initial information about tidal energy may differ from person to person. Third, this study only considers two types of information-c-info and i-info-that can increase support for tidal energy as revealed by Ramachandran et al. [21] , however, in some cases, new information such as impact on marine life or the visible infrastructure, can potentially reduce support for marine energy [19] . Fourth, this model assigns the location in the environment on a random basis, though it may be possible that agents belonging to various hierarchical groups might be found together in clusters. Finally, this model assumes a constant rate of information dissemination through all the cycles. Studies show the rate of information diffusion to be high when the process of dissemination begins, but it gradually tends to dwindle down to lower rates. Moreover, as information disseminates from person to person, the natural trend is an erosion of the initial information [62] . ",
