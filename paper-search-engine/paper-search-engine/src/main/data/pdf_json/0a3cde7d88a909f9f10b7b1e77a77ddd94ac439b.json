Most common clinical patterns include maculopapular rash, perniosis, urticaria, vesicular eruption, livedo reticularis and retiform purpura. [1] [2] [3] The latter has been exclusively described in critically ill patients, often requiring invasive ventilation for massive pulmonary involvement. [4] [5] [6] Retiform purpura can arise in additional circumstances, such as calciphylaxis, cutaneous vasculitis, purpura fulminans and warfarin-induced necrosis. 7 We report a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with associated extensive necrotic retiform purpura and no other organ involvement.",

The lesions appeared a week before and had progressively worsened despite treatment with oral prednisolone. He was otherwise asymptomatic, with no fever. Peripheral oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. His past medical history included only untreated type 2 diabetes mellitus. There was no history of previous medications, such as warfarin, or illegal drugs, including cocaine. Initial workup revealed minor leucocytosis and slightly elevated C-reactive protein (10 mg/L) and D-dimers (354 ng/dL). Haemoglobin levels, platelet count, renal function, liver enzymes and coagulation studies were normal. Although otherwise symptomless, a nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 test was made as a routine procedure, which rendered a positive result.",

Phospho-calcium and parathyroid hormone levels, antiphospholipid, anticardiolipin and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, C3 and C4 levels, cryoglobulin and fibrinogen were normal. Investigation for congenital and acquired thrombophilias, urinalysis and chest X-ray were unremarkable. Urine cocaine levels were negative. A skin biopsy revealed thrombosis of small and medium calibre vessels of the dermis and hypodermis, consistent with thrombotic vasculopathy, without fibrinoid necrosis, calcium deposits or infectious agents. Direct immunofluorescence revealed deposits of fibrinogen, IgG, IgM and C1a. Throughout admission, all previously diagnosed lesions stabilized, and no additional signs or symptoms of other organ involvement were observed.",
