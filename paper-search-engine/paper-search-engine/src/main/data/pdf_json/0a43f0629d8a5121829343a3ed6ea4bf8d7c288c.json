Self-reported data were collected on demographic variables (age, sex, cancer diagnosis), treatments, prior COVID-19 infections, vaccine type and dates of administration, and side effects of vaccination. Samples were collected between March 12 and May 5, 2021. The antibody response 14 days after the second dose of the mRNA vaccines was evaluated in 1,495 participants. Semiquantitative anti-spike serologic testing was undertaken with the Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S enzyme immunoassay with a positive cutoff of at least 0.8 U/mL, which tests for the receptor-binding domain of S and correlates with neutralizing immunity mediated by vaccination (Walsh et al., 2020) . The sensitivity and specificity of the immunoassay (96.6% and 100%, respectively) are excellent for the detection of spike antibodies in response to COVID-19 infections (FDA, 2020) . Patients positive for the nucleocapsid antibody (3.5%), indicating a prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, were removed, leaving 1,445 participants for data analysis. This study was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board, and participants provided informed consent electronically.",

Therefore, the disease itself may impair B cell function, which underscores the abnormal humoral and cellular immune responses previously reported in CLL patients. Higher seronegative rates were observed in patients treated with only BTKi, anti-CD20 mAb therapy, or combinations of these therapies or with venetoclax (a BCL2 inhibitor) compared to those patients who have received no therapy. Consistent with this observation, the serological response to the hepatitis vaccine was nearly absent in BTKi-treated CLL patients compared to a 28% response rate in treatment-naive patients (Pleyer et al., 2021) .

Anti-CD20 mAbs can cause depletion of normal B cells typically lasting about 6-12 months and can suppress the response to previously developed vaccines (Yri et al., 2011) , and CD19 CAR T can suppress normal B cells for long duration after dosing. The use of these two therapies explains why many B cell malignancy patients were seronegative after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In contrast, four of the five patients treated with BCMA or CD138 CAR T therapy for MM were highly seropositive. This may indicate that BCMA CAR T cells may not persist for long periods of time in some patients (Munshi et al., 2021) , thereby permitting a robust vaccine response. Alternatively, BCMA CAR T does not deplete cells that produce anti-S antibodies.",

Unlike the nearly identical efficacy of the mRNA vaccines in healthy volunteers (Creech et al., 2021) , the differences were detected in a population that had a partial response to each vaccine. This may be attributed to differences in the amount of spike mRNA in mRNA-1246 (100 \u00b5g) and BNT162b2 (30 \u00b5g) per dose.
