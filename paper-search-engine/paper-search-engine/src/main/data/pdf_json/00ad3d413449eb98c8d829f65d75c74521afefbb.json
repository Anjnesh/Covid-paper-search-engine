These reductions, sustained for an entire year, would equate to a 9.5-10.1-million-ton reduction in CO 2 e emissions. This is more than 10% of Sweden's annual consumption-based emissions (Naturv\u00e5rdsverket, 2020a).",

This was in order to find out whether any of the lockdown measures could be good candidates for climate change mitigation activities with low cost in terms of decreased QOL. This was an explorative study with cross-sectional design, in which our aim was to quantify associations between Covid-19 restrictions, their climate impact and QOL in a broad sample of people living in the Stockholm Region. The data collection was conducted between May 30, 2020, when the recommendations from the Public Health Agency had been in place for 2.5 months (since mid-March 2020), and June 13, 2020 after which some restrictions were gradually eased. The data collection period was carefully chosen as this was the point in time when public perception in Sweden was that restrictions would be successively lifted, that is, at the perceived end of the first wave of the pandemic.",

The first part of the survey consisted of background demographic questions with multiple choice answer alternatives, as follows: Gender (male/female/other); age (ranges 18-35; 35-45; 45-55; 55-65 and 65+ years) ; main occupation (working; studying; on sick leave; unemployed; on parental leave; retired and other); annual income before tax (under 100; 100-200,000; 200-300,000 ; 300-400,000; 400-500,000; 500-600,000; over 600,000 Swedish Krona); education level (not completed primary school; completed primary school; completed high school; completed university/college); living conditions (living alone; living with one other person; living with several other persons; other); civil status (single; partner; partner but living apart; married; other); number of children living at home (0; 1; 2; 3 or more). Also, the respondents were asked to indicate if they had, during the past half year, undergone a dramatic life event such as the death or illness of a closely related person, separation from a partner, loss of employment, or economic hardship. This survey section was followed by the World Health Organization Quality of Life abbreviated version (WHOQOL-BREF; WHO, 1998) , which has been designed by the WHO to assess health-related QOL in a cross-cultural context. The WHOQOL-BREF is a 26-item questionnaire derived from the WHOQOL-100 survey with 100 questions, that is used to assess overall QOL and considers QOL in four domains, namely, physical well-being, psychological well-being, social relationships, and environment. Each question is scored on a five-point Likert scale, and the domain scores range from 4 to 20, with higher scores indicating better QOL. In addition to collecting WHOQOL-BREF responses as baseline data, the questionnaire was used as an informative \"primer,\" so that participants would have some knowledge about what the researchers meant, when using the term \"Quality of Life\" in the follow-up questions described below.",

Avoiding travel for work is clearly the lowest hanging fruit from a climate and QOL perspective. Decreased consumption seems also to be a potential win-win category. These conclusions are further illustrated in the figures where the compliance levels for each restriction are plotted against the estimated change in CO 2 emissions (Figure 3 ). Our results indicate that avoiding travel for work (\u03a6 = 0.12-0.21), avoiding shops (\u03a6 = 0.15) and avoiding restaurants (\u03a6 = 0.10) are actions which had a negative effect on perceived QOL for less than half (24%-33%, 45%, and 48%, respectively) of the respondents to our questionnaire. We therefore identify these actions as high impact targets for campaigns aimed at encouraging actions to reduce CO 2 e emissions after lockdown. We further note that higher levels of compliance were associated with less negative effects on QOL for travel for work, pointing to this action as an especially promising target for such campaigns. Also, taking into consideration that the lockdown measure of isolating oneself in one's home had a significant negative impact on QOL (F (2.329) = 14.26, p = 0.000), it is not possible to clearly delineate the exact impacts of each lockdown measure on QOL separately -there is bound to be some mediating effects between them. For example, the perceived negative QOL impact of reduced private travel is probably further impacted by the overall sense of isolation. It is thus possible that some of the restrictions assessed in this study would in and of themselves not have the same level of negative impact on QOL, if they were adhered to in a different situation which does not also involve social isolation and seclusion. Finally, we note that during the lock-downs, societal transformations have happened at an unprecedented pace, motivated by the need to protect an older generation from severe illness due to Covid-19; we note that when motivated, societal transformations can happen; and we also note that even post-Covid-19, societal transformations remain vital, motivated by the need to protect a younger generation from severe effects of climate change.",
