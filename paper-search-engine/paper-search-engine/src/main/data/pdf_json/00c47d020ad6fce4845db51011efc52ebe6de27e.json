Simultaneously, while over 83% of physicians believed that RDs constitute a serious public health issue, 17% were of the opinion that mandatory courses on RDs are not necessary in medical curricula and 6.7% were not interested in broadening their knowledge of such diseases. Most respondents derived their knowledge on RDs from university courses, scientific literature and research, as well as from the Internet.",

However, although such diseases seem to be very rare, there can be observed a dual paradox of RDs. Firstly, they include conditions that are often perceived as quite 'common' and are not recognized as RDs, i.e. phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis or achondroplasia. Indeed, it is estimated that from all 6000-8000 RDs, 100 conditions account for 80% of all RD patients [4] . Secondly, while taken individually RDs are rare or ultra-rare, when combined they affect a significant number of people, as approximately 6-8% of the world's population suffer from them. This means that between 300 and 350 million people worldwide are affected, including 27-36 million in the European Union (EU) [5] and 2.3-3 million in Poland [3, [6] [7] [8] . Thus, because RDs affect a very large number of people they constitute an important medical and social challenge and an urgent public health issue [4, 9] .",

            "text": "For this reason, in 2009 the Council of the European Union recommended that RDs should be prioritized and that all member states should adopt a national strategy for RDs [10] . Nevertheless, even though the right to healthcare of all Polish citizens is protected constitutionally and everyone is entitled to equal access to public healthcare, RDs are often overlooked or even neglected by drug makers, doctors, developers, government officials and policy makers, public health programs and news media [11, 12] . For example, although most European countries have either implemented or created national plans for RDs, Poland still has not adopted such a strategy [13, 14] . Furthermore, research conducted among (future) healthcare professionals show that neither do they possess knowledge about RDs nor feel prepared for caring for such patients [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . For example, a recent study shows that while 95% of future nurses, physiotherapists and physicians assessed their knowledge about RDs as insufficient or very poor, a similar percentage did not feel prepared for caring for RD patients. Moreover, 55% of medical students did not see the need to include the RDs topics into the medical curricula [19] . This is important because during their studies future physicians often hear the following teaching pearl: 'When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras!' and are taught that while evaluating a patient, a physician should first consider a common and not a rare diagnosis [20] . However, the 'Don't think zebras' approach reproduces the common belief in the rarity of RDs. Consequently, although most physicians will face the diagnosis or treatment of a rare disease at some point in their professional lives, many assume that they might never meet a patient with a specific RD. Meanwhile, while some RD patients are encountered on a daily basis, the peculiar character of the clinical setting (routine, lots of patients, lack of time) makes it difficult to separate rare from common diseases [21] [22] [23] . Additionally, because the vast majority of RDs are of a genetic character and affect children, many physicians believe that it is mainly geneticists and paediatricians who should be trained with regard to RDs. Meanwhile, as RDs are very complex, require multiple services and care over a long period of time, adequate care coordination is of special importance for people affected by them. For that reason the recognition of RD is important for all medical specialties. This in turn, requires the organization of a multi-professional care that should include not only primary-care physicians but also such specialists as geneticists, neurologists, psychiatrists, immunologists, paediatricians, dieticians, pharmacists or physiotherapists [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . And the first step to achieve this is to assess the physicians' educational needs and fill the gap in their knowledge on RDs. The reason for this is twofold. First, rare conditions considered jointly do affect a very large number of people in the country. Second, only a small percentage of Polish physicians, both primary and specialized care physicians, receive training in RDs during their undergraduate or postgraduate years. Consequently, there is an urgent need to raise the awareness on RDs among physicians. It is even more important as according to the Polish Ministry of Health's declarations, one of the key points of future strategy for RDs should be the improvement of undergraduate and postgraduate education on these diseases [7] .",

This in turn impedes the inclusion of RD patients into society and creates many barriers that prevent the fulfilment of their basic needs, including education [29, 30] . For example, some children suffering from an RD in Australia received a proper diagnosis only after 10 or even 18 years and reported visiting more than ten physicians [31] . Similarly, the mean time of diagnosis for Polish patients suffering from Huntington disease was 10.5 years, although in some cases it was even 30 years [32] . A recent study in Ireland found that 69% of RD patients were diagnosed in adulthood [25] . Consequently, both RD patients and their families have to become self-experts in their disease and educate their physician about their (child's) rare disease [32] [33] [34] [35] . Thus, while it is impossible to know all the RDs that have been identified, physicians should nevertheless be prepared and trained to identify 'the zebras' among the horses.",

This is confirmed by reports from patient organizations and researchers dealing with such diseases [3, 39, 40] . Diagnosing many RDs is extremely difficult and sometimes requires the support of the latest biotechnology. It seems, however, that in addition to systemic and organizational circumstances, the key factor responsible Correct answers are written in bold characters for the occurrence of delays in the diagnosis of RDs is the human one. An error or overlooking evidence is often indicated as the cause of misdiagnosis or delays in diagnosis. Unfortunately, recent reports in this area show that not much has changed in this regard in recent years [41] [42] [43] . As Cismondi et al. rightly observe, \"the academic sector lacks initiatives to improve the knowledge of health professionals on complex topics such as RDs\" [44] . The results of this study seem to have largely confirmed the previous findings [45] [46] [47] and suggest that healthcare professionals' in Poland possess insufficient knowledge on RDs and are unprepared to care for RD patients. Similarly, it was shown that also in other countries, i.e. Belgium or Ireland, where GPs tend to be the first caregivers for RD patients, establish a diagnostic referral and have access to information resources on RDs, few physicians possess adequate knowledge on such diseases and rarely use Orphanet or other reliable sources on the Internet [26, 27] . However, this research also shows that physicians are aware of the importance of RDs, as well as of their knowledge deficits and unpreparedness in this regard. It is hard to disagree with Groft et al. [48] that \"[a] core foundational method to enhance the study of rare diseases is exposing learners to these conditions during their medical education journey\". Thus, the results of our research confirm that for most physicians university classes were the main source of their knowledge about RDs. However, it was surprising that 21.6% of physicians didn't receive any classes about RDs during their studies. Even more alarming was respondents self-assessment of their preparedness for caring for RD patients. One should also bear in mind the role of postgraduate training in this area, since research shows that some physicians are interested in this way of training [49] .",

This is significant as a previous study conducted among future physicians showed some important differences [18] . While medical students declared that geneticists (77.4%), paediatricians (75.5%), neurologists (38%) and immunologists (50.3%) should acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to diagnose and care for RD patients more often than the physicians from this study, they also differed significantly in their belief that also family physicians (46.2%) and psychiatrists (22.8%) should be trained with regard to RDs. Thus, while medical students chose almost all the indicated specializations from the list more often than their already professionally active colleagues, the physicians interviewed in this study indicated the option 'other specializations' more frequently than the students did. This difference is especially surprising when we consider the significant contribution of family physicians in the diagnosis of RDs [42, 50] . Thus, while we may wonder whether these differences result from physicians' post-graduation experiences, there is no doubt that such a difference does exist.",

            "text": "A difference of opinions between physicians and medical students [17] was also observed in relation to their interest in broadening their knowledge about RDs and whether there should be a mandatory course on such diseases (Table 6 ). Physicians not only seemed to be more eager to acquire extra knowledge on RDs but they also saw the need to include the RDs topics into the medical curricula more often. While this is probably due to physicians' professional experience, it appears that students' negative opinions on the idea of additional classes on RDs may result from overloading the curricula and not from their assessment of the suitability of an RD course, especially in that both groups agreed that RDs constitute a serious public health issue. Considering the fact that RD patients constitute 6-8% of the general population, it is puzzling that only three-quarters of physicians confirm ever meeting a person suffering from an RD. Of course, our respondents worked in various health care units, and this fact may have affected their chance of encountering a person with RD, but not meeting such a patient in several or several dozens of years of work is even theoretically impossible. A recent study at a university hospital in Germany showed that patients with RDs accounts for 19% of all hospitalized patients [51] . It is probably the case that not so many of RD patients appear in other health system facilities, but this does not mean that they are not there at all. We can deal here with the biases in judgment, described by Tversky and Kahneman, which reveal some heuristics of thinking under conditions of uncertainty [52] . In the case of RDs and physicians' estimations we deal with representativeness and availability heuristics. If the diseases themselves are called rare diseases, and, in addition, for some reason the respondents failed to learn in the course of their medical studies about their frequency, there may be a problem of correctly estimating the chance of encountering a person with such a disease. As Kahneman described later, mistakes in our thinking have their source in 'the very structure of cognitive mechanisms' [53] . A recent study showed that in the case of medical students, the mere fact of making them aware during the course of a lecture how often they would meet patients with certain RDs in their professional career causes them to change the assessment of the importance of RDs [54] . Of course, this in no way justifies the delay or misdiagnoses in patients with RDs, it only shows the importance of this knowledge for the process of the proper diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. There is no doubt that diagnosing RDs can be a significant challenge, but in order to make it possible at all, it is necessary for the physicians to assume that the patients they see may suffer from RDs.",

However, the observed tendency of many medical journals to reject publications about rare diseases as yielding low citation rates might leave the medical professional insufficiently updated on the progress in this field, should they rely solely on these journals as their source of information on the topic [56] .",

For example, Libura et al. [3] have shown that while over 61% of RD patients in Poland have heard at least one misdiagnosis before receiving the correct one, on average they face 3.5 misdiagnosis. Moreover, 24.1% received their diagnosis after 10 or more years. Interestingly, from 38.6% of patients who were diagnosed properly during the first consultation, many suffered from RDs that are covered with screening tests: cystic fibrosis and phenylketonuria [3, 58] . This is important because due to lack of GP's knowledge on RDs before the correct diagnosis is finally made, most patients with rare or ultra-rare diseases consult a number of doctors and often receive many differing opinions, misdiagnoses or late diagnosis. Consequently, they are exposed to many unnecessary treatments, including tests, drugs, hospital readmissions and surgeries. Moreover, many of these procedures are uncomfortable, frightening or painful and may result in the worsening of an RD patient's condition or even her or his premature death. They also cause additional medical costs for both RD families and the healthcare system.",

Consequently, physicians' lack of knowledge on RD and its negative impact on the diagnostic process has become the most important argument supporting the changes in medical curricula and public policies for people with RDs. For that reason, one of the strategic points in the recent declaration on RD policy made by the Polish Ministry of Health is the improvement of undergraduate and postgraduate education on RDs by including lectures and seminars on RDs during the last 2 years of studies and by creating a system of postgraduate training offering mandatory specialization training sessions and specialized courses on RDs [60] .",

Moreover, although according to the Supreme Audit Office, there are approximately 500 genetic laboratories in Poland, there is still an insufficient number of specialists in the field of medical genetics: in 2017 there were only 122 physicians with specialization in clinical genetics and 194 diagnosticians specialized in the medical genetics laboratory.

This is even more important when we consider the fact that although most RDs occur shortly after birth or in early childhood and Poland currently screens for 28 rare diseases [58] , out of 70% of young physicians who choose residency, very few opt for specializations that are of particular importance from the perspective of RDs: clinical genetics, pediatrics, internal medicine, neurology, immunology, gynecology or child psychiatry.

However, because it is impossible to teach future physicians about each and every RD, it seems that in the first place students should be familiarized with the more common RD as it would allow them to recognize them more rapidly in clinical practice. In addition, students should be taught how to differentiate RD from more common conditions and what actions should be taken when an RD is suspected. 2. Apart from the existing training in molecular biology, diagnostic laboratory and clinical genetics, future physicians should be also trained in genetic counselling which would help them to understand not only the nature of genetic disorders but also what the test results will mean for the patient and one's family, what the limitations of genetic testing are and what treatment and support options are available for RD patients. Medical students should be also trained in clinical genetics ambulatories. 3. To raise students' awareness on the problems that patients suffering from RDs have to deal with, patient organizations and advocacy groups could be involved. Such direct contact with RD patients and their caregivers would help future physicians understand better the challenges persons with RDs face on a daily basis, including the diagnostic pathway, access to the referral system or orphan drugs. 4. During their examinations, including the National Medical Exam, future physicians should be asked some questions referring to RDs. However, due to the reasons mentioned above, such questions should focus on students' diagnostic reasoning, procedure, and management. 5. Postgraduate specialization courses on RDs for physicians and other healthcare workers should be also organized. However, because most physicians lack time and the Internet is the main source of information on RDs, e-learning modules should be organized. They should include tutorial lecturer videos, webinars and PowerPoint presentations. 6. It would be advisable to create a digital application or a specialized information platform with reliable information on standardized and detailed guidance on diagnosis, clinical standard guidelines, referral, counselling, drugs reimbursement, treatment options and centers and the medical insurance system specified for RD. 7. Finally, because most RDs require multidisciplinary approach, an integrated medical service platform should be established to facilitate better communication between various specializations. ",
