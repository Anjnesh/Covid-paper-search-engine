Most restrictions currently persist, although some have been gradually eased. It remains unclear if the trade-off from the unprecedented disruption to air travel was well worth for pandemic containment. Method: A comparative analysis was conducted on Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea's COVID-19 response. Data on COVID-19 cases, travel-related and community interventions, socio-economic profile were consolidated. Trends on imported and local cases were analyzed using computations of moving averages, rate of change, particularly in response to distinct waves of travel-related interventions due to the outbreak in China, South Korea, Iran & Italy, and Europe.",

South Korea's restrictions against all countries came after 91 days, compared to 78-80 days for the other three countries. The rate of change of imported cases fell by 1.08-1.43 across all four countries following the first wave of travel restrictions on departures from China, and by 0.22-0.52 in all countries except South Korea in the fifth wave against all international travellers. Delayed rate of change of local cases resulting from travel restrictions imposed by the four countries with intrinsic importation risk, were not observed.",

Travel restrictions varies across a spectrum, generally classified as border closure, entry or exit ban, visa suspension, transport suspension, arrival quarantine, border screening and other special entry procedure in decreasing magnitude of restrictiveness.",

Quantitative evaluation of their effectiveness is hindered by the inconsistent implementation of other nonpharmaceutical measures adapted to suit different nations. Nonetheless, studies over the years were congruent in proving that almost a 100% shutdown of global travel is required to achieve only modest to negligible effect in delaying the arrival of imported cases or pandemic spread in most cities [3, [6] [7] [8] [9] . In addition, the implementation of travel bans to limit importation risk may seem intuitive theoretically, but is a highly disruptive, costly and resource-intensive measure to implement in reality [10] [11] [12] . It could also lead to dire economic consequences for the affected countries, particularly less developed nations, dis-incentivizing them from reporting future outbreaks. A few travelling infected individuals are sufficient to seed epidemics in other countries, triggering global spread even as the epidemic is mitigated and appears under control at its source [13] . Thus, travel restrictions are almost ineffective in slowing the pandemic evolution if epidemics are not controlled at its source. Robust local control is more likely able to reduce virus transmission [3, 6] , as travel restrictions are often implemented belatedly.",

Despite having extended the travel ban to the entire China by February 1, Singapore recorded its first local case on February 3. New local cases were detected daily and declined after peaking on ii.

While there is consensus that Wuhan's lockdown on January 23 substantially averted exportation of cases globally [58, 59] , Chinazzi et al. (2020) found that the epidemic had already become widespread in other mainland Chinese cities by then [60] . Yet, the first wave of restrictions against imported cases from China were only implemented between January 28 and February 4. In particular, the Europe-related travel restrictions came undoubtedly late for all. Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong respectively recorded imported cases from Europe two weeks before any restriction targeted the region. Phylogenetic analysis of virus strains in Americans traced primarily to Europe since February [61] . This suggests transmission of COVID-19 in European communities even before outbreaks were reported. Like the initial lockdown in Wuhan, restrictions targeted at Europe were imposed only after Europe originated travellers have likely seeded epidemics elsewhere. Constantino et al. (2020) demonstrated that travel restrictions could be effective provided there is only a single source of exportation [62] , often the case only in early stages of an outbreak. Effectiveness diminishes as the outbreak becomes more widespread in the current climate of global connectivity. Substantial evidence suggests the need of a near complete shutdown of global travel to contain the epidemic modestly [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

            "text": "Public response and supplemental policies could undermine the effectiveness of travel restrictions. The imposition of a travel ban invokes heightened risk perception of the banned region. Given the exemption of nationals, residents and dependents from travel bans, their return from disease-affected areas translates to an influx of disease carriers into their home countries. Findings show that the Europe travel ban implemented by the Trump administration caused the final infusion of COVID-19 cases in America as an estimated 15,000 more Americans who had high risk of exposure returned following the announcement [67] . Singapore noted persistently high numbers of imported cases despite its first Europe-related travel ban on March 16. WHO's declaration of COVID-19 a pandemic and Europe its new epicenter on March 11 and 14 fueled a spike in risk sentiment towards the region. On March 15, the Ministry of Education in Singapore recalled students on overseas placement and internships [68] . A 14-day stayhome notice (equivalent to a quarantine) was also mandated for those returning from ASEAN countries, Japan, Switzerland and the United Kingdom [69] , causing travellers to swarm back in avoidance of quarantine. On March 17, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs further recalled Singaporeans studying abroad. These events collectively underlie the persistent rise in imported cases after March 16, driving up the incidence of imported cases in Singapore. Although we did not find similar recall advisories from Taiwan and Hong Kong, imported cases in Hong Kong towards late March largely constituted students who had been studying overseas, indicating a similar demographic among returnees. As states are responsible for their citizens abroad, governments may also evacuate citizens stranded in epicenters. Singapore conducted repatriations from Wuhan [70] , Iran, UK, Cambodia, Egypt, India and Nepal [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] . Taiwan evacuated its citizens on at least 3 occasions between February 4 and March 29 while Hong Kong had repatriated 533 evacuees from Wuhan between March 4 and 5 [77] . South Korea deployed at least 3 chartered flights to bring back 848 evacuees from Wuhan between January 30 and February 11 [78, 79] , with additional repatriations in late March and early April from Germany, Italy, Nepal and India [80] . This concurrent occurrence of multiple policies interplaying with public responses highlight the importance of strict and efficient arrival quarantine following travel bans to prevent spread to the community [81, 82] .",

            "text": "Airport screening is commonly the first line of defense in border surveillance. While Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan supplemented it with travel bans and quarantines throughout the course of the pandemic, South Korea employed it as its main mode of defense for the longest period. Its special entry procedure encompassed a health and travel declaration alongside fever screening as travellers were also required to download a smartphone application to report their health condition over 14 days [83] . However, asymptomatic carriers or mild presentation of symptoms in infected individuals [84] limits the effectiveness of symptomatic border screening. Through April 6, less than half of imported cases in Taiwan developed febrile illness over the course of disease [85] while 90% of imported cases in Singapore over three days in March did not show symptoms upon arrival [86] . A recent study attributed undocumented infections as the source of 79% of documented cases [87] , indicating that a reduction of undocumented infections through active case finding could help with the control and curb COVID-19 spread. The presence of undocumented imported cases is extremely perilous during the early stages of the epidemic as it introduces the virus to a na\u00efve population. This study could not discern if higher number of cases imported to South Korea in the absence of quarantine before March 22 manifested in greater secondary local transmission as we did not find consistent positive correlation between rate of change in imported and local cases. However, Hossain, et al. (2020) found that even a full-scale border control without proper quarantine measures will only have limited effect if epidemic growth at the source is already high [82] . Drawing from Taiwan's data, 67.3% of imported cases from January 21 to April 6 undetected during airport screening went on to infect 19 individuals, constituting 36.5% of local infections [85] . Enforced physical distancing through quarantine is, hence, essential in supplementing border control measures that may miss asymptomatic travellers, those incubating the disease or purposely concealing their fever [88] .",

However, this decreasing trend may also be attributed by an extensive push for social distancing in the respective countries. Most of the community distancing measures undertaken were relatively matched in pace [89] [90] [91] . Closure of most entertainment venues started in late March. While stricter distancing rules were imposed in public spaces in Singapore, the equivalent was disseminated as advice in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea.

Local cases have remained sporadic throughout the early stages of the epidemic even without denying entry to travellers, suggesting that arrival quarantines are sufficient to prevent spread to the community when complemented by robust local control measures. Enhanced laboratory testing of influenza-negative patients with severe respiratory symptoms doubled as effective sentinel surveillance for COVID-19 in the community. Active COVID-19 testing was extended to patients with severe respiratory symptoms in the community in Taiwan and Hong Kong from mid-February, and Singapore as early as late January [92] [93] [94] [95] . From March 19, Hong Kong made it compulsory for asymptomatic individuals under mandatory quarantine to undergo COVID-19 swab tests. Taiwan and Singapore, on the other hand, retrospectively tested symptomatic cases. South Korea only started testing all European arrivals for COVID-19 since March 22. Active case-finding and contact tracing are crucial in epidemic control. Despite the different approaches in COVID-19 testing, all four countries were reputed to have wellutilized widespread testing and/or aggressive contact tracing using data analytics. In South Korea, testing was accessible to the public as test kits and drive-through checkpoints were available from February. Digitalized contact tracing and transparency in information disclosure constitutes the core of Korea's containment efforts [96] , while Taiwan integrated its national health insurance database with immigrations and customs data to aid in rapid case identification [97] . For Singapore, contact tracing is an elaborate operation entailing multiagency cooperation, surveillance footage and data visualization that was deemed gold standard by the WHO in early February.",

As Singapore did not report symptom onset date and South Korea reported neither symptom onset dates of cases nor individualized case data, cases in our analysis were based on confirmation date instead of symptom onset, a more accurate measure of epidemic progression. The analysis for South Korea was also constrained by missing data during the mid-February to March period when local epidemics broke out. Due to geographical and connectivity differences, the trend of imported cases observed cannot be generalised. In addition, imported cases were not normalized to travel volume affected by mounting travel restrictions at the borders due to the lack of publicly available data at the required granularity. This potentially hindered a more accurate quantification of true risk posed by COVID-19 importation, barring existing travel restrictions, into the four countries.",

South Korea went further in having widespread publicly accessible testing facilities (drive through) since early February. Testing in the four countries differed in coverage. Additionally, testing in Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong is reactive, mostly government-mandated due to plausible exposure, while the South Korean population is actively encouraged and supported by the government to do so [99] , contributing to early and greater detection.

Apart from the disease characteristics, cultural and systemic differences may influence healthseeking behavior of the population. Factors like low socioeconomic status, differing medical coverages and different cultural and beliefs can also deter communities from seeking help upon illness [102, 103] .

It was only in early March that Singapore extended its ban to all South Korea orginated travellers, together with the restrictions circumventing the third wave of epidemics in Iran and Italy. Following the third wave, imported and local cases in Singapore consistently surpassed that of Taiwan and Hong Kong. South Korea did not implement any restrictions on Iran and Italy.",

While Singapore banned travellers who have been to China 14 days prior to entry, cases from China remained the main source of importation before March 4. A fall in rate of imported cases was observed only until mid-February. This suggests that preventing importation of cases from epidemic regions through travel restrictions was effective only for a short duration before scattered cases from the epidemic regions streamed in from other regions. Following the final wave of restrictions, the rate of change of imported cases fell by 0.35, 0.22 and 0.52 respectively for Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The rate of change in local cases across all 4 countries showed unremarkable differences in trajectories in the early stages.
