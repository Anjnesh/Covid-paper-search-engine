Sequencing 17 of the viral stock showed it to be 100% identical to the deposited Genbank sequence and no 18 contaminants were detected (2). SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 (hCoV-19 19/England/204820464/2020, EPI_ISL_683466) was obtained from Public Health England via 20 BEI Resources (Manassas, VA, USA). The supplied passage 2 material was propagated once in 21 was performed in Vero E6 cells in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, 24 USA) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 25 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (DMEM2). Vero E6 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 26 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin 27 (DMEM10). Mycoplasma testing of cell lines and viral stocks is performed regularly, and no 28 mycoplasma was detected. 29 Study design. Eleven SARS-CoV-2 seronegative AGMs (3.8-6.7 kg) were divided into 2 groups 30 for infection with either the contemporary D614G strain (RML7) (n=5) or the recently emerged 31 B.1.1.7 (UK variant) (n=6). A Nasal Mucosal Atomization Device (Teleflex, MAD110) was 32 used to deliver 10 6 infectious particles (5x10 5 per naris diluted in 500ul DMEM with no 33 additives). Clinical examinations were performed on days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7. Blood and serum were 34 collected for hematology, blood chemistry, coagulation and virological analysis. Oral, nasal and 35 rectal swabs were collected at every examination for virological analysis. Bronchial cytology 36 brushes were collected on days 3, 5 and 7 and bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were also 37 collected on days 3 and 5 for virological analysis. Tissues were collected following euthanasia 38 on day 7 for pathology and virological analysis. Studies were performed in successive weeks and 39 different animal study groups to avoid contamination between studies, the D416G study was run 40 first followed by the B.1.1.7 study. 41 Virus titration. Virus isolation was performed on tissues following homogenization in 1 mL 42 DMEM using a TissueLyser (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and inoculating Vero E6 cells in 43 plate with 200 \u00b5L of 1:10 serial dilutions of the homogenate. One hour following 44 inoculation of cells, the inoculum was removed and replaced with 200 \u00b5L DMEM. Virus 45 isolation of blood and swab samples were performed in a similar manner. Samples were vortexed 46 for 30 seconds before performing the 1:10 dilution series. The inoculum (200ul) was placed on 47 cells and rocked for 1h. Infectious supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh DMEM. 48 Seven days following inoculation, cytopathogenic effect was scored and the TCID50 was 49 calculated using the Reed-Muench formula (4). 50 Viral RNA detection. qPCR was performed on RNA samples extracted from swabs or tissues 51 using QiaAmp Viral RNA or RNeasy kits, respectively (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). Viral 52 RNA was detected with one-step real-time RT-PCR assays designed to amplify total viral RNA 53 (N gene) (5) or sgRNA by amplifying a region of E gene to detect replicating virus (6). Dilutions 54 of RNA standards counted by droplet digital PCR were run in parallel and used to calculate viral 55 RNA genome copies. A Rotor-Gene probe kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) was used to run 56 the PCRs according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 57 Hematology, Serum Chemistry and Coagulation. Hematology analysis was completed on a 58 ProCyte DX (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME, USA) and the following parameters were 59 evaluated: red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular 60 volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin 61 concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution weight (RDW), platelets, mean platelet volume 62 (MPV), white blood cells (WBC), neutrophil count (abs and %), lymphocyte count (abs and %), 63 monocyte count (abs and %), eosinophil count (abs and %), and basophil count (abs and %).",

Concentrations of cytokines and chemokines present in the serum from 72 SARS-CoV-2 infected AGMs were quantified using a multiplex bead-based assay (1:4 dilution)-73 the LEGENDPlex Non-Human Primate Cytokine/Chemokines 13-plex (BioLegend, San Diego, 74 CA USA). Analytes detected by this panel are the following: IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, 75 MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, MIG, TNF-\u03b1, I-TAC, RANTES, IP-10, and Eotaxin. Samples were diluted 1:4 76 in duplicate prior to processing according the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were read 77 using the BD FACS Symphony instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA USA) and analyzed 78 using LEGENDplexTM Data Analysis Software following data acquisition. 79 Thoracic radiographs. Ventro-dorsal and right/left lateral radiographs were taken on clinical 80 exam days prior to any other procedures (e.g. bronchoalveolar lavage, nasal flush). Radiographs 81 were evaluated and scored for the presence of pulmonary infiltrates by two board-certified 82 clinical veterinarians according to a previously published standard scoring system (7). Briefly, 83 each lung lobe (upper left, middle left, lower left, upper right, middle right, lower right) was 84 scored individually based on the following criteria: 0 = normal examination; 1 = mild interstitial 85 pulmonary infiltrates; 2 = moderate interstitial pulmonary infiltrates, perhaps with partial cardiac 86 border effacement and small areas of pulmonary consolidation (alveolar patterns and air 87 bronchograms); and 3 = pulmonary consolidation as the primary lung pathology, seen as a 88 progression from grade 2 lung pathology. At study completion, thoracic radiograph findings 89 were reported as a single radiograph score for each animal on each exam day. To obtain this 90 score, the scores assigned to each of the six lung lobes were added together and recorded as the 91 radiograph score for each animal on each exam day. Scores range from 0 to 18 for each animal 92 on each exam day. 93 Histology and Immunohistochemistry. Tissues were fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin 94 with two changes, for a minimum of 7 days according to an IBC-approved SOP. Tissues were 95 processed with a Sakura VIP-6 Tissue Tek, on a 12-hour automated schedule, using a graded 96 series of ethanol, xylene, and PureAffin. Embedded tissues were sectioned at 5 \u03bcm and dried 97 overnight at 42\u00b0C prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Specific staining was detected 98 using SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody (Sino Biological cat#40143-MM05) at a 99 1:1000 dilution. The tissues were processed for immunohistochemistry using the Discovery 100 Ultra automated stainer (Ventana Medical Systems) with a ChromoMap DAB kit (Roche Tissue 101 Diagnostics cat#760-159) (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN, USA). 102 Statistical analyses.
