The current Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has led to massive restrictions in health care and social life worldwide. People with PWS represent a particularly vulnerable population group to these restrictions, with unknown impact on their mental health. Methods We conducted an online questionnaire to assess the impact of the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of people with PWS. Results One hundred and eight caregivers completed the survey about individuals with PWS. Individuals with PWS > 6 years (n = 89) were included for evaluation with regard to psychopathological change. Respondents frequently reported an increase in psychopathological symptoms associated with PWS during the lockdown, with 51.7% reporting increased temper outbursts, 43.8% showing signs of sadness, 38.2% being anxious, 55.0% more irritable, and 39.3% showing more food seeking behaviour.",

No significant difference could be found between the sexes. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the mental health of individuals with PWS, evidenced by an increase in behaviours associated with PWS, including temper outbursts, food-seeking, and irritability, which again underlines their need for specialised care. Individuals living with their families were particularly vulnerable, indicating that they and their families are in special need of support.",

The resulting disease is known as and is characterised by a variety of symptoms, most of which include fever, cough and shortness of breath, but more specific symptoms such as loss of taste have also been described. The course of the disease appears to be variable with mild flu-like symptoms, sometimes unnoticed infections up to a severe course with fatal consequences (Esakandari et al. 2020) . As part of German government's measures to contain the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic, the operation of healthcare facilities was reduced to a minimum. Childcare facilities such as daycare centres and schools were closed, and far-reaching restrictions of social contacts were implemented with restrictions on visits to hospitals, nursing homes and institutions for people with disabilities.",

PWS is caused by a lack of paternally expressed genes on chromosome 15q11.2-13, which can occur via three mechanisms. In most cases (70%), PWS is caused by a deletion of the 15q11-13 region on the paternal chromosome 15. In about 25% of cases, it is caused by a uniparental disomy, and in the remaining 5% of cases, deficits in the imprinting centre lead to PWS (Angulo et al. 2015) . Infants with PWS typically present with muscle hypotonia, a failure to thrive and feeding difficulties, followed by the later development of severe hyperphagia with excessive eating leading to morbid obesity if food intake is not controlled. Individuals with PWS are in need of intensive monitoring, especially with regard to food intake. A low-calorie diet and regular physical activity are recommended. In nearly all cases, a mild to moderate intellectual disability and an overall developmental delay in language and motor skills are present. Dysregulated body temperature, high pain tolerance and sleep disturbances are also typical symptoms of PWS, most of which can be attributed to hypothalamic dysfunction (Muscogiuri et al. 2019) .",

Of course, retrospective surveys also tend to suffer from recall bias. It should also be considered that parents, whose children live in specialist facilities, probably not have daily contact, so their assessment of psychopathology may be less accurate. This assumption could also contribute to the differences in psychopathology between the types of accommodation. Our study, as the first of its kind, should be seen as pilot study in this respect.
