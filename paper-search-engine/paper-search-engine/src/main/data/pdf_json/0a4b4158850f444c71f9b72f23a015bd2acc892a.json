This prompted the authors to suggest that patients with COVID-19 receive high-fat diets to increase serum TG levels and decrease the PTNT. 6 However, the role of TG in COVID-19 is still unclear. Therefore, we retrospectively studied the characteristics of patients with different TG levels and analyzed the factors that affect TG levels, to preliminarily understand the pathophysiological mechanism of TG in COVID-19.",

To avoid the effect of drugs on TG levels, 12 patients were excluded (one case was treated with hydroxychloroquine for chronic systemic lupus erythematosus, six cases were treated with statins, and six cases were treated with lopinavir and ritonavir tablets). Thus, 174 patients were included in the study. According to \"The Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) final report,\" 7 patients with TG \u2265 1.7 mmol/L were included in the study and divided into two groups, high TG group (n = 78) and control group (n = 96). Information for all patients was retrospectively collected through the electronic medical record system, and included demographic characteristics, medical history, symptoms and signs, laboratory test results, SaO 2 at the time of admission without oxygen, and final clinical outcomes. Laboratory examination during the course of the disease showed leukocyte and lymphocyte levels were at their minimum values and TG, serum ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, creatine kinase, and fasting blood glucose levels were at their maximum values. Laboratory tests were carried out early morning in a fasted state, while the examination frequency was subject to disease changes throughout hospitalization. A total of 132 patients were tested for HbA1c, and no glucocorticoid drugs were used before the test. The diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 were based on the \"New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program (Trial Seventh Edition)\" 8 by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Comorbidities were treated according to the corresponding guidelines. Nonsurvivors and a small number of survivors used antibacterial drugs and glucocorticoids. All patients had good compliance with the treatment. All patients were followed up until April 6, 2020.

TG is degraded by lipoprotein lipase to produce free fatty acids, which can activate the nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway, leading to the high expression level of various proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. 9 Elevated levels of triglyceride-rich particles in the bloodstream may induce local inflammation and the activation of complement and coagulation cascades, ultimately promoting endothelial dysfunction. 10, 11 In addition, TG may be related to the excessive activation of macrophages that causes the deterioration of COVID-19 patients. In this study, regression analysis showed that TG levels were positively correlated with serum ferritin and IL-10 levels. In the course of inflammatory diseases, infections, and malignant diseases, macrophages expressing CD163 obtain iron by clearing hemoglobin. As a result, the synthesis of ferritin in the cells increases, and its release into the blood also increases. 12,13 IL-10 is derived from a variety of cells and is considered to be an inhibitor of inflammation and immunity. It can regulate the metabolism of macrophages by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. 14 Many studies, including pathological studies, have shown that macrophage overactivation plays a Fasting blood glucose (mmol/L) 4.11-6.05 5.7 (5.1-7.1) 6.0 (5.3-7.9) 5.6 (5.0-6.5) .321",

All the patients in this study were hospitalized before the global epidemic of COVID-19. At that time, there was no effective intervention except oxygen therapy. The pathophysiological characteristics were more easily revealed in these patients as the natural progression of the disease could be analyzed in the absence of additional therapies. In other words, the lack of effective medication at the time presented with a unique opportunity in this small sample size retrospective research to reveal the relationship between TG and prognosis, serum ferritin, and IL-10.",

First of all, this is a small sample size retrospective study conducted in a single geographical area Therefore, the results should be considered as preliminary findings. In particular, the small number of deaths leaves uncertainty whether elevated TG is an independent risk factor for death in COVID-19 patients. Second, due to special circumstance, these patients could not be followed up long-term outside the hospital. The follow-up data is necessary to explore the relationship between inflammation and TG. Thus, larger trials with more prognostic indicators and long-term follow-up are needed to determine the relationship between TG and prognosis.",
