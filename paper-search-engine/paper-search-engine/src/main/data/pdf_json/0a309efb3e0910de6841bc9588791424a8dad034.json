Given the current uncertainty about the course and duration of the pandemic continues, and the prevalence of diabetes in many populations worldwide, the role of whether family history of diabetes in predisposition to damaging SARS-CoV-2 outcomes is important to know as diabetes can be prevented. We investigated the association of family history of diabetes with the risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 and severe SARS-CoV-2, and the potential role of demographic and lifestyle factors in such a link.",

Lifestyle factors such as smoking, BMI and physical activity are likely to influence the risk of COVID-19 and/or associated complications as evidenced by previous studies. A separate study using UK Biobank data found higher risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 with physical inactivity, smoking and obesity but not heavy alcohol consumption. 10 In addition, relationship between unhealthy lifestyle and severe disease risk was dose dependent. Another study by the COVID-19 host genetics initiative found similar association between high BMI, smoking and physical activity and higher risk severe COVID-19 illness using mendelian randomization approach. 11 Hopkinson et al. found that people who smoke were at higher risk of developing symptomatic COIVD-19, based on data from 2.4 million UK users of the Zoe COVID-19 symptom study. 12 A study in United States found that patients with COVID-19 who were physically inactive had a higher risk of hospitalization, ICU admission and mortality, with some evidence of dose-response relationship. 13 We accept some limitations. UK Biobank participants are relatively healthier and more affluent than general UK population although there is some evidence that risk factor associations with health outcomes are generalizable. 14 The work did not differentiate Also, we could not fully adjust for all incident diabetes; only admissions for diabetes were adjusted for. In addition, information on lifestyle and underlying health was based on self-report and these data were collected more than 10 years ago. During the early study period of the 'first wave' of the outbreak in England, SARS-CoV-2 testing was highly selective and limited to only those participants who presented with severe symptoms. There was no association found between family history of diabetes and severe SARS-CoV-2 risk when analysis was limited to those who tested positive to reduce the bias due to selective testing. That said, this sensitivity analysis by no means excludes bias as those initially tested for SARS-CoV-2",

Of course, other unmeasured factors could also have biased the chances of testing. Therefore, we believe our main findings hold relevance to those with family histories of diabetes.The association of being SARS-CoV-2 positive with family history of diabetes may partially reflect both a strong association between excess body weight and SARS-CoV-2 infection or related mortality (as recently summarized in a UK Governmental report)15 and the strong social factors (ie lower socioeconomic status) linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection that overlap with diabetes risk. The risk attenuation after adjustment for lifestyle factors provides some reassurance that healthy lifestyle may not only attenuate risk of diabetes in those with strong family histories but may also attenuate risk of SARS-CoV-2 disease and severe complications. The sensitivity analyses also point in similar direction. However, this attenuation in risk is likely related to lifestyle over many years and so our findings do not necessarily demonstrate that short-term change in lifestyle would immediately alter the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, although such short-term changes can prevent diabetes. Our findings may stimulate those with diabetes family histories to take more interest in preventive efforts.
