As there is a growing interest in using large amount of image data for research purpose and acquisition of large amount of medical image is now a standard practice in the clinical setting, efficient handling and storage of large amount of image data is important in both the clinical and research setting. In this study, four classes of images were created, namely, CT (computed tomography) of abdomen, CT of brain, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of brain and MRI of spine. After converting these images into JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) format, our proposed CNN architecture could automatically classify these 4 groups of medical images by both their image modality and anatomic location. We achieved excellent overall classification accuracy in both validation and test sets (> 99.5%), specificity and F1 score (> 99%) in each category of this dataset which contained both diseased and normal images. Our study has shown that using CNN for medical image classification is a promising methodology and could work on non-DICOM images, which could potentially save image processing time and storage space.",

The reason for using the DICOM standard is to ensure that all the medical images made by different machines, hospitals or companies can speak the same language and therefore operate within the same environment. Each DICOM file has a header containing data such as patient demographic information, acquisition parameters and image dimensions. The remaining portion of the DICOM file contains the image data [1] . The header information is encoded within the DICOM file so that it cannot be accidentally separated from the image data. If the header is separated from the image data, the image will not be displayed properly [2] . However, there are times that these DICOM images would be converted into different format such as JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) or PNG (Portable Networks Graphics) for reasons such as they are of smaller file size or supporting website display. In such scenario, the information that the DICOM image carries would be lost and unable to retrieve. Among these other file format, JPEG is the most popular format as it can be read by all computer platforms. However, as JPEG format uses lossy compression, it may suffer from compression artifacts or loss of details which may affect image interpretation, and is therefore generally avoided for diagnostic purpose.",

As there is a continuous interest on medical images research using machine learning methods, a need to pre-process and classify large volume of image data is growing since assigning human to recognize, sort and organize every medical image is laborious and error-prone [3] . What is more, efficient handling of large amount of image data is also important in the setting of teleradiology [4] . Although we could use text-based retrieval method to categorize medical images since DICOM header contains information on body part and image modality, previous research have shown that about 15% of images contained false tag entries which can result in wrong categorization [5] . Therefore, a reliable pure imagebased classification algorithm would be applicable in both clinical and research setting.",

The goal of this study is to see if CNN can accurately discriminate medical images from their imaging modalities and anatomic location after they have been converted into other image format, namely JPEG format.

After multiple attempts, further modification was made for the CNN to contain five sets of convolutional layers followed by batch normalization layer, ReLu layer and then Max Pooling layer. The filter size for the all five convolutional layers were 3-by-3 but we gradually increased the number of filters so that there were 8 filters in the first convolutional layer, 16 filters in the second, 24 filter in the third, 32 filters in the fourth and 48 filters in the fifth convolutional layers.

            "text": "In this digital age, many medical images may be converted into different file format to be carried around and for various purposes such as education or consultation. Converting DICOM images into other file format also has its necessity in both clinical and research setting as it allows for faster image transmission and reduces file storage space. However, after conversion, they would lose their DICOM header information and one can no longer identify the image location and modality without expert's help, which is the first step in using these images for various purposes. Using human expert's visual inspection for image classification can be laborious and error-prone. Our result showed that using our simple convolutional neural network, we could achieve very high performance in classifying both image modality and anatomical location on JPEG images. This can be useful in the clinical setting such as teleradiology as one could use JPEG for its advantage on faster image transmission and restore them to remove the compression artifact associated with JPEG images as proposed by Chung et al [4] . Also, earlier work done by Szot et al have shown that using both JPEG-and JPEG2000-compressed images from the digital camera and a view-box allow readings of sufficient quality for the diagnosis of tuberculosis on chest X-ray, this means that using JPEG image for diagnostic purpose could suffice under specific condition and appropriate setting. A reliable, automatic, pure image-based classification algorithm also has its demand in the research setting. Pizarro et al developed a deep learning algorithm using CNN architecture to automatically infer the contrast of MRI scans based on the image intensity of multiple slices for database management purpose in their research center. The MRI contrast dataset at their second part of study included fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), proton-density weighted, T1-weighted, post-contrast agent, T1-weighted pre-contrast agent, T2-weighted, high resolution T1-weighted, magnetic transfer ON, and magnetic transfer OFF. The CNN algorithm they developed could automatically identify the MRI contrast of previously described dataset with a less than 0.2% error rate, which was markedly lower than the random forest algorithm that had 1.74% error rate for the same MRI dataset [11] . A similar idea was investigated upon by Remedios et al for a similar purpose, in which they developed a novel 3D deep CNN-based method for MR image contrast classification. Specifically, they investigated on three classification tasks. Firstly, to identify T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR contrasts. The second task was to identify pre versus post-contrast T1-weighted images. The third task was to identify pre versus post-contrast FLAIR images. They achieved a mean accuracy of 97.57% across the 3 tasks [3] . Compared with our work, their work focused on classifying different image contrast or sequences of the same image modality, namely MRI, and the same anatomical location, namely brain. Remedios et al showed some examples of the misclassified images by their proposed algorithm, and they were due to either severe artifact or pathologies. This is similar in our study in which one of our misclassified images had intracerebral hemorrhage.",

They showed that CNN had 100% classification accuracy using the JPEG dataset and the accuracy rate was 94.4% for SVM, and 88.9% for ANN. The classification accuracy, using the DICOM dataset, was 100% for CNN, SVM, and ANN. Moreover, they reported a shorter processing time for one JPEG image (7 seconds) compared with DICOM image (10 seconds) for CNN [10] . This study could further justify the advantage of choosing CNN as the algorithm for pure image-based classification and JPEG as the image format.",

The body region recognition was performed by image matching in the whole-body phantom image which they built a series of templates to compare with.

They used AlexNet and GoogLeNet to classify 10 classes, namely, brain, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast-enhanced and plain images and found that the best overall accuracy was 0.721 for the classification of 10 classes by using GoogLeNet and 10000 image slices. Also, the best overall accuracy for the classification of the slice position without contrast media was 0.862 by using 2000 image slices dataset with AlexNet [13] . Sameer Khan et al tried to identify the same organs (lung, liver, heart, kidney and lumbar spine) from five different imaging modalities (CT, MRI, Positron emission tomography, ultrasound and X-ray images) by using a modified CNN architecture based on AlexNet. They achieved a validation and test accuracy of 76.6% and 81% respectively. This result outperformed three milestone CNN architectures namely, AlexNet, LeNet and GoogleLeNet which had test accuracy of 74%, 59% and 45% respectively [14] . Their result showed that the architectures used for natural image classification cannot be generalized on medical images and modification of the basic CNN architecture could yield better results for the task of medical image anatomy classification. This result is similar to our findings that modification of hyperparameters was required for medical image classification after we adopted the CNN architecture that was originally designed for hand-written digit data. Holger R. Roth et al developed a convolutional network with five layers of convolution filters to identify 5 classes of anatomy in CT images namely, neck, lungs, liver, pelvis and legs. Their testing set error rate improved from 9.6% prior to data augmentation to 5.9% after data augmentation [15, 16] Compared to their work, our study had a much higher accuracy rate (> 99.5%) but we focused on identifying anatomic location rather than specific anatomic organs.",

It would have been interesting to compare the accuracy rate between JPEG and DICOM images using the same algorithm as the conversion of DICOM to JPEG format resulted in information loss which may impact the classification accuracy rate. However, Maruyama et al have already shown that there was no difference in classification accuracy between JPEG and DICOM images using CNN and that using JPEG image benefited from a shorter processing time. Therefore, we would assume that the difference in accuracy would have been small if this comparison was made. Secondly, we did not perform any image pre-processing for this study and only used the preset window level for our model. However, our excellent classification accuracy result could justify for the lack of image pre-processing and proved that using the preset window level was enough to perform this task well which also saved image processing time. Thirdly, we did not choose all the sequences in the two MRI classes, only those we thought was representative on that certain image modality and anatomic location, which might hinder its accuracy rate if applying this CNN architecture to other sequences in real life scenario. Fourthly, a limited number of test set examples were included in this study. Fifthly, only 4 categories out of two image modalities and three anatomical locations were selected in this study, this could hinder the ability of generalization in the real life.",
