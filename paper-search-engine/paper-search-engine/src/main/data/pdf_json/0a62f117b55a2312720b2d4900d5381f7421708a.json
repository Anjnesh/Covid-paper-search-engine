The objective of this study is two-fold, one substantive and one methodological: substantively to evaluate the association of demographic and health records with two related, yet different, outcomes of severe COVID-19 (viz., death and ICUA); methodologically to compare interpretations based on logistic regression and on gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) predictions interpreted by means of the Shapley impacts of covariates. Very different association of some factors, e.g., obesity and chronic respiratory diseases, with death and ICUA may guide review of practice. Shapley explanation of GBDTs identified varying effects of some factors among patients, thus emphasising the importance of individual patient assessment. The results of this study are also relevant for the evaluation of complex automated clinical decision systems, which should optimise prediction scores whilst remaining interpretable to clinicians and mitigating potential biases.",

Identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. Several studies have sought to identify factors predicting poor outcome following COVID-19 infection [5, 6] and assist clinician decision making [7] [8] [9] . A traditional method such as logistic regression can infer the odd ratios (ORs) of the outcome in the presence of a risk factor. Modern machine-learning technologies, widely implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, can handle more complex patient data types, offer greater generality, and produce more accurate predictions than the previous methods, but at the cost of losing transparency and interpretability [10] .",

The COVID-19 Hospitalization in England Surveillance System (CHESS), a UK system distributed by Public Health England (PHE) and adapted from the UK severe influenza surveillance system, collects extensive data on patients admitted to hospital, including known comorbidities and important demographic information (such as age, sex, and ethnicity) [11] . This large national dataset reduces limitations inherent in small cohorts, enabling more reliable identification of associations. We performed analyses on this dataset using logistic regression and a more general machine-learning model (the gradient-boosted decision tree, GBDT), which generated interpretable predictions by means of the Shapley additive explanation, a technique that mitigates the interpretability issue in machine-learning outputs. For different applications of this technique to COVID-19 research see, e.g., references [12, 13] . Through these methods, we demonstrated the extent to which preexisting conditions differentially predicted death and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Some factors affected both similarly but others proved to be protective for one while increasing the risk for the other, or showed very different effect sizes. We also identified variation of effects among patients. These results may be useful to clinicians assessing hospitalized patients with COVID-19. They may also provide a greater context or benchmark for individuals evaluating or interpreting complex automated clinical decision systems designed to identify those most at-risk.",

The dataset includes epidemiological data (demographics, risk factors, and outcomes) on patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by 28th June 2020 who required hospitalization. We included all available chronic and pre-existing morbid conditions recorded by PHE as potential risk factors, including immunosuppression due to disease, asthma requiring medication, immunosuppression due to treatment, neurological conditions, respiratory conditions, obesity, type-1 and type-2 diabetes, hypertension, heart conditions, renal disease, liver diseases, and other comorbidities [11] . No acute illnesses or medical conditions were considered. In the CHESS dataset self-defined ethnicity is categorized according to the Office for National Statistics questionnaires into 17 factors, all included in the study. With 8628 patients, white British was the largest group in the cohort and therefore chosen as a reference category. 1895 patients did not identify themselves with any ethnicity and were labelled as \"NA\". With the exception of age and admission date, all features were stratified to binary variables. Entries labelled \"diabetes\" whose type was unknown and not recorded in the database as \"type 1\", have been considered as \"type 2\". Death and ICU admission were chosen as outcomes. The median age of this sample was 70 years (IQR 56-81, range 1-105), 59.25% were men and 0.18% had an unrecorded sex. The prevalence of comorbidities is reported in Table 1 and ethnicity in Table 2 .

Each individual tree consists of a series of nodes that represent binary decision splits against one of the input variables, with its final output being determined by the nodes at the end of the tree (known as leaves). The model was implemented in the XGBoost library (version 0.81) [15] and depended on a number of hyper-parameters. To avoid over-fitting, these hyper-parameters were selected by means of Bayesian optimization of c-statistics using 5-fold cross-validation over the training set [16] with constant L1-regularisation parameter \u03b1 = 0.5. We used Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis to understand the result of a GBDT model fit [17, 18] .

The regression was adjusted for other comorbidities including type-1 diabetes, chronic liver disease, serious mental illness, chronic renal disease, chronic neurological condition, chronic heart disease, hypertension, obesity and asthma, none of which were significantly associated with death (BH test). Having any comorbidity other than these was recorded in the dataset as \"other comorbidity\" and appeared to be a protective factor (OR death, 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.95). Some self-reported ethnicities, compared to white British, were associated with substantially increased risk of death (e.g., Indian (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.42-2.73)) risk of death. Asymptomatic testing was associated with substantially lower risk of death (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.18-0.45). The estimated ORs of deaths are detailed in Table 3 and illustrated in Fig A in S1 Text. Table 3 ). Each of these had far weaker or even negative associations with death. Some features associated with increased risk of death such as chronic respiratory disease were negatively associated with ICUA (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.96). No ethnicity was negatively associated with ICUA compared to white British although there was substantial variation across these. Other factors associated with ICUA included immunosuppression due to treatment (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.41-2.28) and male sex (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.58-1.89). Old age (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.74-0.78 for each 10-year increment), asymptomatic testing (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.35-0.74), and pregnancy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.20-0.57) were associated with decreased ICUA. The associations of each predictor with death and with ICUA are illustrated in Fig 2, highlighting some contrasts in direction and magnitude while other risk factors appear more consistently associated with the two outcomes.

In almost all asthma patients, it is possible to appreciate negative impact on death and positive impact on ICUA. Patients with type-1 diabetes, chronic renal disease, or chronic neurological disease show positive association with death and negative association with ICUA outcome, although with very dispersed Shapley value distributions. Upon visual inspection, the scatter points for chronic liver disease, type-1 diabetes, chronic neurological, and chronic heart comorbidities show two (or more) clusters with respect to the impact on death. The hypertension scatter plot displays a neat partition with respect to the impact on ICUA outcome, showing that this variable was associated with ICUA. Its impact on death is less clear, with patients having discordant or concordant Shapley values for death.

            "text": "Black or Asian minority ethnic groups showed higher odds of death and substantially higher odds of ICU admission in our data compared to white British patients. Similar findings to ours have been demonstrated UK-wide. Multivariable analyses from large multi-ethnic cohorts have suggested that Asian and black patients group experienced an excessive level of mortality, hospital admission, and intensive care admission even when differences in age, sex, deprivation, geographical region, and some key comorbidities were taken into account [5, 28, 30, 31] . White Irish ethnicity was non-significantly associated with lower risk of death (OR 0.49, BH test). This finding, adjusted for all covariates, echoes findings in an earlier study comparing death rates standardised for age and region using census data [30] . Chinese ethnicity predicted ICU admission (OR 10.22 with respect to the white British baseline) most strongly, followed by black Caribbean (OR 5.25) . For these and other minority groups the association with ICU admission far exceeded that of death. An unrecorded or unknown ethnicity was strongly negatively associated with ICU admission, but not strongly associated with death. This may indicate increased recording of ethnicity on ICU admission, a potential cause of bias in estimating true differences in risk of ICU admission across ethnicities. Age, type-1 diabetes, and neurological, heart, and respiratory diseases were negatively associated with ICU admission but not death. Age and chronic respiratory disease were strongly positively associated with death. Data gathered across the USA showed that deaths are 90 times higher in the 65-74 age group than the 18-29 age group and 630 times higher in the 85 and older group [36] . This may reflect judgements of limited capacity to benefit from ICU admission due to age and some co-morbidities. Type-2 diabetes is broadly reported to be associated with poor outcome in COVID-19 patients, while studies reporting outcome for type-1 diabetes are rare [32, 33] . A national general practice based analysis in England demonstrated that both type-1 and type-2 diabetes are associated with increased risk of in-hospital death with COVID-19 [34] . Our multiply adjusted analysis of the CHESS dataset confirmed that type-2 diabetes had a strong association with mortality (and non-significant association with ICU admission), while type-1 diabetes' association was positive but not statistically significant. On the other hand, type-1 diabetes was negatively associated with ICUA outcome. There is uncertainty regarding the effect of diabetes and glycaemic control on COVID-19 outcome. Whilst some suggest a 3-fold increase in intensive care admission and death [24] , others found no association between glycaemic control and severe outcome [26] . Potential mechanisms for effects could include hyperinsulinemia or the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 receptors expressed in pancreatic \u03b2 cells [32, 37] .",

The explanation models assigned a concordant (discordant) impact on death and ICUA to the patients in the white (grey) regions. The scatter plots expose not only the importance of a potential risk factor but also its range of effects over the cohort. All patients with immunosuppression disease, type-2 diabetes, liver and respiratory disease, and Pakistani self-defined ethnicity had positive Shapley values from death, with impact on ICU ranging from negative to positive values, thus suggesting that these conditions were always leaning towards death but sometimes not consistently towards ICUA. Conversely hypertension always have positive impact on ICUA whilst can either have positive or negative impact on death for different patients. The Shapley values for death for many features appear clustered (T1 diabetes, chronic liver, neurological, and hearth disease comorbidities), thus suggesting the presence of different groups under the same labels with different effect on patient health. Inspection of the age pattern suggests the presence of a group of young patients (blue markers) with negative impact on both age and ICUA outcome, old-age patients with positive impact on death and negative impact on ICUA outcome, and intermediate-age patients with impacts negative on death and positive on ICUA outcome.

These models are very complex, but evidence indicates that mortality predictions can be obtained from more parsimonious models, upon selecting the most important features, thus facilitating more efficient implementation of machinelearning in clinical environments [44] . Despite these successes, prediction models have been found overall to be poorly reported and at high risk of bias in a systematic review [45] . A comprehensive list of relevant works is out of the scope of this paper, but it is worth underlining that machine-learning methods typically excel in outcome prediction but lack ease of interpretation of the result. In this study, we bridged the gap between performance and interpretability in machine learning for poor outcome predictions in COVID-19 patients. We trained GBDT models (see Materials and methods section) and extracted not-only their predictions, but also the extent to which each potential risk factor contributed to the prediction overall (thus Overall, the association of patient features with the final outcome (measured by the SHAP importance scores Imp, see Materials and methods and Fig 5) is consistent with the logistic regression results, although the two models are intrinsically different. Moreover, for each feature, we derived an individual Shapley value for each patient, allowing us to consider the variation in effects among patients. As a first example, we discuss interpretation of type-2 diabetes. In the summary plots of Fig 4 and Figs C and D in S1 Text, the red markers correspond to type-2 diabetes patients and blue to patients without type-2 diabetes. In the summary plot for death outcome (Fig C in S1 Text, see also Fig 4) , the red and blue markers are grouped into two distinct clusters. All the type-2 diabetes patients had positive Shapley values, thus showing that such a comorbidity was always associated with death, while all the other patients had nearly zero Shapley values. Conversely, in the summary plot for ICUA outcome (Fig D in S1 Text, see also Fig 4) , the red markers appear scattered. Some T2-diabetes patients had positive Shapley values (positive association with ICU admission) while others had negative values (a negative association with ICU admission). The summary plots thus show not only the overall importance of a potential risk factor, but also its range of effects over the patients. In this case our interpretation is that although consistently increasing the risk of death, the presence of type 2 diabetes had more variable impact on decision making around ICU admission, in some cases apparently adding to the case for admission and in some cases diminishing it.",

Conversely, for example, chronic renal disease and immunosuppressive treatment had low impact on predicting death for some patients, but very high impact for others, perhaps reflecting that these categories comprise a number of diverse conditions and therapies. Considering ethnicity, most minority groups were consistently and positively associated with ICUA but the impact attributed to Pakistani ethnicity were much more variable.",

In Fig 6A, the predicted probability of death is shown to increase with age, in part due to increasing presence of comorbidities which are correlated with increasing age (Fig 1) . In fact, the isolated effect of age (the SHAP main effects for age), illustrated in Fig 6C, shows a sharp rise from age 30 even if it is stripped from the interactions with the other factors. For ICUA, the SHAP main effect for age abruptly drops and even reverses from the 60th year of age (Fig 7) .

Declining in-hospital mortality was observed in Italy [46] and England [47] during the first pandemic peak. This may reflect a mix of changing pressure, developing clinical expertise and variable follow-up time following admission. We included the patient's admission day in our models to allow for these effects in adjustment (logistic regression) and attribution of impact (machine learning). Hospital admission later than March decreased both death and ICUA. These results mirror the PDPs outlined in Figs 6A and 6B and 7A and 7B, showing that a local explanation technique such as the Shapley value analysis supersedes and is consistent with the global explanation of the PDPs. The performance gains of the GBDTs here are small, in part due to the fact that all but two predictors (age and admission date) are binary. Indeed, the logistic model predictions depend on a linear combination of the predictor values, which is adequate if all the predictors are binary and the classes are linearly separable. The similarity in the predictive power for these specific cases should not shadow the other advantages of the GBDTs (including their greater generality and their ability of detecting non-linearity and variation in predictive effect). While all our models had excellent performances, it is worth noting that prediction of ICUA outcome was significantly better than death alone prediction for both. Including laboratory test results in the predictor variable may improve death prediction [48] .",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study confirms that, in hospitalised patients, the risk of severe COVID-19, defined as either death or transfer to intensive care unit, is strongly associated with known demographic factors and comorbidities. We found that the association of these variables with death was often qualitatively and quantitatively different from their association with ICU admission. This was consistently derived by means of two different predictive models, i.e., the standard logistic and the GBDT machine-learning models. The Shapley value explanation of the latter model also highlights the sometimes variable impact of each factor for each patient. These results allow an insight into the variable impact of individual risk factors on clinical decision support systems. We suggest that these should not only grant the optimal average prediction, but also provide interpretable outputs for validation by domain experts. Shapley values may also support analytical approaches to address the problem of characterising the group of patients for whom a prediction is incorrect. This is an important additional potential area for research and application. Shapley-value analyses allow clinical interpretation of the results from a complex machine-learning model such as the GBDT. Using these we have derived importance scores which are consistent with the better known ORs as an overall assessment of an average effect but can additionally display the extent to which this average effect is consistent across patients or highly variable among different patient groups. We recommend the wider adoption of Shapley-value analyses to support interpretation of ML outputs in clinical decision making given this capacity to communicate the variation in the effects of predictive variables. These aspects are particularly valuable to tackle COVID-19, a complex disease that can cause a variety of symptoms and clinical outcomes, depending on the patients' conditions, and rapidly overwhelm healthcare systems, thus requiring large-scale automated decision systems.
