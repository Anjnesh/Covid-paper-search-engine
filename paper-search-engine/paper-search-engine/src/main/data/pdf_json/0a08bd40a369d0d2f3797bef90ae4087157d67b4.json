Figure 1 plots several car manufacturers' average CO 2 emissions in 2019 compared to 2015, as well as the 2020/2021 target values [3] . While the target emissions have decreased by 27% over the five-year period, the emission performance of actual passenger cars in 2019 is far below the upcoming target regulations. Moreover, in 2019, the European Council agreed on CO 2 emission standards for new vehicles produced after 2020 [4] . In 2030, the average CO 2 emissions of new passenger cars should be 37.5% lower than in 2021.",

            "text": "The ever-intensifying regulations pertaining to emissions and fuel economy have resulted in the recent growth of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . To reduce emissions, automakers have spurred the development of eco-friendly vehicles that provide cleaner, more efficient, and safer performance, such as Battery-powered Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), and Fuel-Cell Vehicles (FCVs) [10] [11] [12] . As shown in Figure 2 , the EV share has increased in the global passenger car and light-duty vehicle market over the past ten years [13] . The EV market share is eventually expected to account for more than 25% of the market by 2030. Currently, BEVs already surpass HEVs' global sales, and are predicted to account for 81% of all new EVs sold by 2030. In addition, due more than 25% of the market by 2030. Currently, BEVs already surpass HEVs' global sales, and are predicted to account for 81% of all new EVs sold by 2030. In addition, due to the EV development having a lower barrier to entry compared to internal combustion engine technologies, the number of EV startups has increased. Currently, the success of Tesla, which now accounts for the majority of EV sales, is accelerating the growth of EV startups [14] . The relatively large number of early adopters of EVs makes it a suitable topic for personalization research. There are various factors that affect consumers' adoption of EVs [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . In studies on consumer EV adoption, factors affecting the adoption of EVs included consumer perceptions of the environment, fuel efficiency, and the fact that new types of vehicles-especially EVs-can influence decisions to buy EVs.

In studies on consumer EV adoption, factors affecting the adoption of EVs included consumer perceptions of the environment, fuel efficiency, and the fact that new types of vehicles-especially EVs-can influence decisions to buy EVs. Such research provided some understanding of individuals' perceptions of EVs and the personal requirements needed to adopt a new type of car. Notably, other potential customers have resisted purchasing EVs due to the difference in longitudinal driving feel caused by the differences in the powertrain structure of EVs and Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs). As a result, the study of EVs needs to include an investigation of the driver's personal satisfaction, not just research on how to enhance performance.",

This is particularly important in the field of advanced driver assistance systems, where the goal is not only to improve the driving experience, but also to improve driving safety and prevent accidents caused by human error. Since such a system can only be effective when used in practice, it becomes necessary to gain the driver's confidence, meet expectations for driving behavior, and not annoy the driver with irrelevant recommendations and precautions. However, driver expectations vary from driver to driver and within individual drivers, depending on the driver's condition and the driving situation.

Explicit personalization requires users to explicitly change their system by specifying their preferences and choosing the specific system settings that work best for them. Such an adaptive system limits the user's choices to the system's suggestions, but allows direct control. The main drawback of these systems includes limitations in the number of settings that the user can intuitively understand. For more complex support functions, it is very difficult to design settings, for example, as potential stings can go far beyond simple sporty and comfortable driving modes. In addition, the combined effect of setting several parameters at the same time is very opaque to the user. Conversely, implicit personalization observes a user's behavior without directly requesting preferences from the user and derives a user model for predicting user preferences or behaviors based on these user data.",

For example, three predefined clusters for acceleration profile parameters were proposed. According to the driver, one of the three clusters is selected in order to change the target acceleration profile characteristics. Furthering this selection, Rosenfeld et al. [36] classified drivers into the three groups through a large data set and using a regression model and a decision tree. However, it is difficult to reflect the group-based predefined sets of driving styles for each driver due to the great diversity of individual preferences and the fact that drivers might change their driving styles depending on the driving conditions. Therefore, several studies have proposed driver models that directly map vehicle states through deterministic equations into control inputs, such as speed, acceleration, and pedal operation, based on an individual's driving style [26, [39] [40] [41] . In recent years, with the growth of computing devices and the rise of big data research, many researchers have applied data-driven learning models to driver behavior predictions. Markov models stochastically predict driving states for the uncertainties of real-driving situations [42] [43] [44] . Deep neural network models [45] [46] [47] [48] have also been popular because they can provide accurate prediction performance and handle a large amount of data. However, neither of these methods are suitable for use in real-time embedded systems. This paper primarily focuses on approaches for personalizing EV driving performance, which belongs to the category of implicit personalization, in order to model users through driver behavior observations.",

EVs consist of a much simpler powertrain and have an inherent advantage, as they use an electric motor instead of a standard engine. The electric drive motor has a wide range of performance coverages, with a fast response and high torque at low speed. In addition, as the transmission becomes unnecessary, linear control is possible, so performance adjustments are easier to apply.

We propose a correction method for the target torque calculated using the look-up table of the motor rotation speed and the accelerator pedal position under the condition of manual driving. The target torque table was calibrated through repetitive experiments to provide standard acceleration performance; previous studies added correction look-up tables based on vehicle specifications to compensate for the target torque. The limitations of these approaches were that the correction look-up tables consider only the target motor's own operation range and provide discrete correction results. To overcome these limitations, the proposed method determines correction factors based on personal driving features, such as the target driver's preferred maximum acceleration and maximum jerk. To ensure stability, the proposed correction factor can reflect various driver preferences at a high degree of freedom, while limiting the range of each factor according to the target motor specifications.",

In such a situation, the driver's propensity for acceleration, deceleration, and stopping can change.",

The target route is located at a planned city in Incheon, South Korea, and the number of moving vehicles is very small, so the driving experiment constraints can be freely set. A total of five drivers performed data acquisition through the same scenario. Each driver repeatedly stopped and started while following the route. There were three intersections, and by continuing to turn right, the drivers could travel the same route indefinitely. The stopping point was each time a vehicle crosses an intersection on the target route. At that time, the driver faced a straight path and was able to accelerate freely. Furthermore, since there were no obstacles in front, the individual driving characteristics of the driver appear through the behavior of the vehicle. The reason why the data acquisition was not performed on a public road but proceeded under a restricted condition is that the driver's behavior can change even if the driving scenario changes only slightly. Therefore, if the driving environment changed, the variability of the driver's driving style increases, and it makes no sense to compare it from driver to driver. ",

This definition is used to filter out acceleration situations that do not reflect the driver's intention, such as vehicle inertia or acceleration due to driving downhill. Within this defined section, the motor generates propulsion torque through the driver's APS operation, thereby causing the vehicle to accelerate. The situation in which the feeling of acceleration felt by the driver in the acceleration section is dominant is during the initial acceleration. Therefore, we defined the initial acceleration section as the section in which the slope of the APS is positive. The initial acceleration section is considered as a transition period for obtaining the desired acceleration by the driver. In this section, the driving torque gradually increases until reaching a peak, and the vehicle acceleration also reaches a peak.

The personalization accuracy was evaluated based on the absolute error and percentage error of the medians. First, in the case of the 3rd driver, since they are the standard driver, the results were not affected by the APS or personalization algorithms, so the median of the maximum acceleration was the same in both the experimental and simulation results. Note that though a very small error of 0.17% occurred, it was due to modeling errors.",

The driving features are physical values that can express longitudinal driving behaviors among vehicle states, and display different tendencies depending on the driving pattern. In order to personalize longitudinal vehicle behavior, the quantified driving features are applied to the traction motor controller of the EVs. The traction motor controller calculates the target torque based on the accelerator pedal position in order to reflect the driver's intentions. In this process, we utilized the quantified driving features to calculate the correction factors of the target torque. This driver-specific correction provided satisfactory propulsion performance for each driver. The proposed algorithm was then validated through simulation studies consisting of a precise EV model. The validation results confirmed that the proposed motor controller could reproduce different acceleration behaviors for identical accelerator pedal inputs. Through a comparison between the experimental and simulation data, the distributions of each driving feature displayed a high similarity. In the case of the maximum acceleration, errors in the distribution medians were lower than 3%.",

            "text": "The proposed target torque personalization satisfactory improves individual driving. The target torque table is generally calibrated through experiments to satisfy standard acceleration performance. The previous research introduced look-up tables of the correction factors to adjust the torque within a range of motor specifications. The limitations of the previous research were that the correction look-up tables depended on the motor's operation range and showed discrete correction results. To overcome these limitations, the proposed algorithm automatically calculates the correction factors through personal driving data analysis. Furthermore, to prevent stability problems, the proposed correction factor is limited according to the target motor specifications. The adjustment of the EV's output torque greatly affects not only vehicle performance but also driving safety. For example, if the driving tendency a driver selected as a personalization target is excessively aggressive, it is not necessary to compensate for the driver unconditionally, but to offer support within the range that guarantees driving safety. Even if it is possible to tune the motor to achieve higher acceleration according to the specifications of the EV, safety must be ensured with a certain margin, and a service that recommends improving driving style rather than personalization to drivers outside the range must be provided. In addition to the acceleration performance discussed in this paper, personalization in the ADAS field has safety as the top priority, and research is being conducted to provide a personalized function for each driver within the possible range.
