The communication aspect is of high importance in educational research. Additionally, it is difficult to assess as it involves multiple relationships and different levels of interaction. Social network analysis (SNA) allows the visualization of this complexity and provides quantified measures for evaluation. Thus, initially, SNA techniques were applied to create one-mode, undirected networks and capture important metrics originating from students' interactions in the fora of the courses offered in the context of distance learning programs. Principal component analysis and clustering were used next to reveal latent students' traits and common patterns in their social interactions with other students and their learning behavior. We selected two different courses to test this methodology and to highlight convergent and divergent features between them. Three major factors that explain over 70% of the variance were identified and four groups of students were found, characterized by common elements in students' learning profile. The results highlight the importance of academic performance, social behavior and online participation as the main criteria for clustering that could be helpful for tutors in distance learning to closely monitor the learning process and promptly interevent when needed.",

However, lately, new powerful tools and massive changes in the educational demand have brought Distance Learning into the spotlight of our personal and social lives. Two milestones cultivated the hype of online learning in the past decade: the rise of MOOCs and the Covid-19 pandemic. The revolution brought about by the massive participation in MOOCs and the proliferation of Open Educational Resources originated in conventional universities that mainly provided face-to-face courses (MIT, Stanford, Yale, etc.) New educational models that fueled participation were adopted but at the same time, the dropout rates were skyrocketed (Laurillard et al., 2018) . The massive public acceptance and adoption of online courses created significant challenges and urged researchers of the educational field to find answers to important questions concerning teaching and learning quality, learners' behavior, policies, educational design, and many other relevant issues.",

Driven by this notion that \"learning analytics is about learning. As such, the computational aspects of learning analytics must be well integrated within the existing educational research\" (Ga\u0161evi\u0107 et al., 2015) , we adopt a three-layered learning analytics methodology that is immersed into our educational research of investigating traits of students that facilitate learning in a distance education scenario.

Thus, it is necessary to replace those missing properties so that the educational activity could regain its social character. Michael G. Moore (2007) addresses the problem of geographical separation in the transactional distance theory, using the concepts of structure (that concerns the educational methodology) and dialogue (between learners, tutors and teaching material) to explain how learners' autonomy is affected in a distance learning course. At the same time, Conectivism, a new educational theory, fine-tuned with the internet era, emerged by Siemens and Downes (2008) . Connectivism expands the social aspect of learning in the digital age stressing that knowledge lies within networks, where nodes of information are linked in a meaningful way. Thus, SNA techniques enriched our data with network related metrics and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) analysis allowed us to create a new latent space of lower dimensionality. Consequently, we were able to cluster students' community, dentify common learning patterns and create actionable information.",

In online learning environments, the lack of direct communication is compensated by the vast amount of available data generated in the educational context. Therefore, we are aiming to propose a multilayered methodology that would make good use of these data to produce actionable conclusions for the improvement of the educational process as it is conceived by the students. Two main aspects of learning are taken into consideration in our proposed methodology: the academic performance indices and the social interaction indices. The objective of our research is not focused on the prediction of the final achievement. Instead, we attempt to explore features that go beyond Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and uncover deeper aspects of learning. We aim to identify groups of typical students' profiles, so that tutors could easier make targeted interventions. Thus, data from a full academic year, along with students' grades, were used to create an integrated image about their learning behavior and evolution as members of a learning community. Hopefully, a more sophisticated taxonomy than the dipole \"good student-weak student\" will occur. The identification of learning behavioral patterns could lead further research about performance prediction and the creation of early warning systems. In addition, it is of high importance to quantitatively imprint the contribution of each variable concerning different aspects of the learning process deriving by students' digital traces. This result would allow the creation students' profiles with increased accuracy. We summarize the goals of our study in the following research questions:",

This methodology should be threefold, in the sense that it should include: a) a process that would capture learners' social interaction, b) a process that would group variables and would explain their relations and c) a clustering method for the students' community based on the intergraded features. Every layer of analysis would provide new variables based on the previous layer in order to create a new space where latent features can best describe students' interactions of high complexity. RQ2: Within a number of available primitive and derived variables, what is the contribution of each one of them, how are they correlated and which principal components can capture the majority of the variance? In particular, we attempt to explore the contribution of observable features (like the number of views or the number of posts), together with academic performance features (like grades) and more advanced attributes concerning students' interaction. By definition, some of these variables are interrelated. Thus, it is necessary to explore their relations. In addition, in the search of a simple, yet elaborated way of describing the learning behavior in an online setting, it is necessary to indicate factors that would bring together the important attributes and would transform our data, preventing biased and skewed results and reducing the multidimensionality of the problem. RQ3: Which obvious or latent features signify the evolution of learning between different learning communities and how do they differentiate the structure of the learning community? Each methodology which is tested in the context of a specific course, produces results which are strongly related with a number of factors concerning the scientific field of the course, the educational design, the teaching and assessment methods and many others. However, the learning process is much alive, constantly transforming the learning community. Moreover, the learning process itself changes within the learning community as the learners and their tutors adapt to the demands of a society that constantly builds up ties and balances the behavior of different personalities and learning profiles. Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate different learning communities so that will be able to identify those aspects that capture their evolution as a whole but also individually.",

Educational organizations have already started to reap the benefits from this potential and researchers show increased interest. A significant factor for successful tutoring and student guidance in a Distance Learning Course goes hand in hand with the direct access of the educational stakeholders to accurate and updated information. Therefore, a Learning Analytics (LA) approach that can provide for this actionable information that is missing from the process itself, is a necessity in Distance Education. Often there is a mismatch between the ideal dynamic of a group of students and their actual potential (Hern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda & Su\u00e1rez-Navas, 2017) . The importance and the benefits that LA offers to education are highly recognized (Sergis & Sampson, 2017) as it can shift the educational research in deeper understanding (Viberg et al., 2018) and provide the means to tailor learning experience according to individual learners needs (Tsoni et al., 2019a, b, c) . The knowledge originated by LA in order to be actionable has to be meaningful. However, not all meaningful knowledge is actionable. As Ga\u0161evi\u0107 et al. (2015) pointed out, some significant predictors of academic performance (i.e., the number of logins) cannot be used in a practical sense to improve academic performance if they don't come along with suggestions for teaching and learning improvement.",

Chiu & Hew (2018) demonstrated that the number of views in a forum, had greater predictive power than the number of posts a student makes. The need that the forum activity has to be investigated in a deeper level than by simply looking to posts' counts was also proven by Sun et al. (2018) who studied the impact of students' grouping tactics on the forum interaction. The importance of selecting advanced, tailored tools that can provide analysis that captures the complexity of group or community formation in distance learning was stressed by Hern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda, and Su\u00e1rez-Navas, (2017). Methodological issues are treated thoroughly by the LA community.

Two successive studies (Lotsari et al., 2014; Kagklis et al., 2015) leveraged Network Analysis of forum activity to create students' profile based on their online participation. Network representation through time revealed the evolution of students' community and along with polarity analysis can provide insights into the social aspect of their learning behavior (Tsoni et al., 2019a, b, c) . The idea of a detailed analysis, including the content of the discussion fora, was one of the main findings of a literature review conducted by Cela et al., (2015) . Additionally, social network metrics derived from the forum activity were used as indicators of the structure of communities of practice and communities of inquiry (Jan & Vlachopoulos, 2019) .

In this respect, there are two widely used algorithms: HITS that produces the metrics \"Authority\" and \"Hub\" and the PageRank algorithm that was initially designed as a measure of influence. Both are based on the Principle of Repeated Improvement that is an iterative process where an initial value is assigned to a node and then a re-weighting process begins re-assigning new values according to each node's connections until the convergence criteria are met. In a students' communication network, this process allows to efficiently imprint the augmented influence of a person in the community as she/he establishes her/his relations with other participants considering their level of influence also. In the next subsection, the main characteristics of these algorithms are briefly discussed.",

            "text": "Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS), is a link analysis algorithm for webpages ranking (Kleinberg, 1999) . HITS algorithm is also known as \"Hubs and Authorities\". Initially, a hub and an authority value are assigned in each node according to its incoming and outgoing edges. An iterative process begins correcting these values until a default point of convergence is met. A high value of hub means that the node points to high authorities i.e., nodes with valuable information, represented as nodes with high in-degree in a directed network. Respectively, a node with high authority is being pointed by good hubs in a mutually reinforcing relationship. A good hub adds value to an authority and subsequently, the authority becomes better, adding more value to the hub in a recurrent process that, after several iterations, converges to a final result. The degree of convergence e (epsilon), that determines the ending point of the iterative algorithm is the maximum divergence between two sequential results. Thus, at first, each node p is assigned with a hub value and an authority value equal to one ( x <p> = 1 and y <p> = 1) . Then, these values are recalculated according to the incoming and the outgoing links of the nodes respectively. The operation that updates the weights for hubs and authorities ( x <p> :authority update rule, and y <p> :hub update rule), respectively are: and where V is a collection of nodes represented as a directed graph G = (V, E) and a directed edge (p, q) indicates the presence of a link from p to q. In a one-mode undirected network the incoming links (represented by the in-degree) and the outgoing links (represented by the out-degree) are the same because of the reciprocity of each edge. Therefore, hub and authority result to same value. In the sample network the highest hub and authority is assigned to Node D and the lowest to the node C. Nodes A, B and E have the same value of hub and authority because they are connected to the same nodes creating triangles (that means that each one of them is directly linked with all the direct connections of its neighbors).",

The third step was to run statistics to get centrality measures and more complex algorithms' outputs (HITS and PageRank). For the iterative algorithms the degree of convergence epsilon used was e = 0.0001. Finally, the metrics' output was exported and merged with the dataset to prepare the next level of analysis.

Even though we investigate certain interactions in a closed and relatively controlled environment, without including cultural or personal data, the high complexity remains, creating a large volume feature space, difficult to interpret. Dimensionality reduction is a statistical process providing fewer parameters and a simpler structure maintaining the majority of variation. Exploratory factor analysis can reveal can provide insight into the learning process are reveal traits that weren't obvious in the preliminary multidimensional space. There are several methods of dimensionality reduction. We chose to operate PCA. PCA is an orthogonal transformation that provides principal components as a linear combination of the initial variables weighted by their variance. This allows us: a) to simplify our study coping with fewer, unrelated components, b) to easily visualize the new lower-dimensional feature space, c) to use the main components that capture the majority of variance for further analysis (see cluster analysis below), d) to examine the impact of the initial variables and interpret the results.",

A main feature of the program is that it is targeting at a wide range of attendants leading to a significant heterogeneity in the community of learners. The first course (hereafter Course A) is a compulsory firstyear course that signifies students' first contact with the program, and for many of them, their first experience in Distance Learning. The second course (hereafter Course B) is a second-year optional course. This choice is driven by RQ3 that refers to the development of the students within the learning process in a Distance Learning course. Basic information about Courses A and B is presented below in Table 4 . The proposed methodology was tested in four main steps. The first step was the data retrieval from several sources. The second step included all the pre-processing actions (anonymization, data selection and exclusion, data cleaning and merging, and preparation for the modeling tools). The next step was the threelayered modeling process described in Sect. 5. Results emerging from a layer of modeling were used as derived variables for the next modeling action.

All three types of conversation can be supported by the discussion forum where, additional, those who do not actively participate can be benefited too. The first research question (RQ1) was aiming to propose a process that takes into account both academic and social aspects of learning. The proposed methodology was thoroughly described in Sect. 6.

Active participants with a high academic profile can act as the More Knowledgeable Other (Vygotsky, 1978) enhancing the learning process. Additionally, the combination of grades and network metrics revealed outliers in both courses. The first extreme case is a student in Course A, a \"super-poster\" Fig. 22 Authority distribution for both courses. The left graph refers to Course A and the right graph to course B. Purple bars denote students and blue bares denote tutors who heavily contributed to the forum community. However, a mass quantitative contribution does not necessarily imply a qualitative contribution (Huang et al., 2014) . Network metrics indicate that this is the case with the certain student as he/she is engaged in a large number of threads with a reply rate far greater than the average, insisting on long dialogues often only with his/her tutors. The second outlier is a student in Course B whose academic and social performance was steadily high. However, he/she didn't sit the final exam. It is obviously a case where personal barriers led the student to fail the course. Similar cases stress the importance of the communication and phycological support that goes beyond tutoring and provide second chances for students in need. The combination of metrics also reveals small differences between students that denote different learning styles and behaviors like the example presented in Sect. 7.1. One of the main findings of this study regarding the contribution of certain variables to the explanation of students' learning behavior comes from the dimensionality reduction process. The PCA pointed three unrelated principal components that explain over 70% of the variance in both courses. The first factor is the network position factor that gathers all network metrics, proving the importance of the social aspect of learning as it is express in the discussion forum community. The second factor is the academic performance factor relying on students' grades, and the online presence factor is mainly related to the number of views. This result describes all students, regardless of the course they participated in even though the communities that were analyzed had significant differences in their structure and their participants' behavior.",

            "text": "Several findings indicated the maturation of the learners' community as they pass from a first-year compulsory course to a second-year optional course (RQ3). Already by comparing some of the primitive variables some simple, yet important differences occur. Students performed better in Course B. Moreover, in Course B a greater percentage of students participated actively in the forum community. On the other hand, students in Course A were visiting more often the forum just to read other participants' posts, indicating passive participation. The online participation becomes more substantial in Course B, where derived network metrics indicate that more students undertook central roles in the interaction community. The higher quantity and quality of second-year students' participation in the forum implies an increasing acceptance of the facilitating function of the forum community in the learning process. The network visualization illustrates complex relations that reveal the structure of the community as a whole, as well as individual features derived from each node's position. The differences in the networks' structure ( Fig. 18 ) reveals that Course A was a novice, tutor-centered community that contained many peripheral participants. On the contrary, the graph created by Course's B participants interaction was a more \"small-word\"-like network, where students tend to act more autonomously, building relationships with peers in a more coherent community. These results are also confirmed by the distribution of the network metrics presented in Sect. 7.3. The final step of data modeling included a cluster analysis. Two out of the four clusters that emerged in each course had common features: the first one contained high-graded students who actively participated in the forum community, and the second contained less sociable students with good academic performance. However, in Course A the same cluster contains all poorly performed students, regardless of their social behavior, whereas, in Course B there were two separate clusters of low-graded students: one with those who participated actively in the forum community and one with the non-participants (who also had slightly worse grades). The cluster of the low-graded and socially active students is a typical group of students where intervention has to be made. They were probably interacting with the learning community seeking support, but unsurpassed barriers prevented them from succeeding. Finally, it is important to note that the clusters in Course A are much more coherent (Mean Squared Error = 0,49) than clusters in Course B (Mean Squared Error = 1,14) indicating more homogeneous groups of participants.",

Full non-participation Even though this classification was rather a theoretical approach in the Community of Practice educational theory, LA confirms the existence of these groups. The experimental testing of the proposed methodology produced clusters that, in some cases, match the abovementioned classification. Cluster 1 of the Course A and cluster 2 of the Course B could match the full participation group (i). Clusters of Full non-participation (iv) were identified in both courses (cluster 4 in both courses) while clusters 3 and 2 of the Course A and Course B respectively, could be included in the Legitimate peripherality (ii) group. However, cluster 1 of the Course B that contains active participants with low academic performance cannot be assigned to any of the four groups of Wegner's classification. This fact provides a strong indication that other parameters apart from forum activity should be intergraded when studying learning communities.",

The experimental design and evaluation brought into light some interesting results for students' profiling as well as for their communities' structure. Dawson et al. (2019) highlighted the need for an integrative, complex, and holistic view to understand the dynamics outside of a specific course that influence learning performance as learning experience does not limit to a single course. The selection of two successive courses allowed us to compare the learning habits of the participants and get a sense of their evolvement in the learning community. There are some common features between courses but also some important distinctions signifying the change that comes along in students learning path. However, the three principal components that similarly emerged for the two student communities, highlight the important factors that can describe learning behavior based on observable attitudes of their digital traces. The repeatability of the results is an issue of many related aspects. In our future work, we plan to automate the proposed LA process, flexibly, so that the experiments could be repeated in different settings, providing results with higher generalizability.",
