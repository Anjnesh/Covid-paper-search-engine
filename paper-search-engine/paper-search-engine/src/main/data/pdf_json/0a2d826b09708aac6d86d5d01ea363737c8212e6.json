            "text": "Objective: We aimed to estimate the incidence of cerebral sinus and venous thrombosis (CVT) within 1 month from first dose administration and the frequency of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) as the underlying mechanism after vaccination with BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, and mRNA-1273, in Germany. Methods: A web-based questionnaire was e-mailed to all departments of neurology. We requested a report of cases of CVT occurring within 1 month of a COVID-19 vaccination. Other cerebral events could also be reported. Incidence rates of CVT were calculated by using official statistics of 9 German states. Results: A total of 45 CVT cases were reported. In addition, 9 primary ischemic strokes, 4 primary intracerebral hemorrhages, and 4 other neurological events were recorded. Of the CVT patients, 35 (77.8%) were female, and 36 (80.0%) were younger than 60 years. Fifty-three events were observed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 (85.5%), 9 after BNT162b2 (14.5%) vaccination, and none after mRNA-1273 vaccination. After 7,126,434 first vaccine doses, the incidence rate of CVT within 1 month from first dose administration was 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38-0.78) per 100,000 personmonths (which corresponds to a risk of CVT within the first 31 days of 0.55 per 100,000 individuals) for all vaccines and 1.52 (95% CI = 1.00-2.21) for ChAdOx1 (after 2,320,535 ChAdOx1 first doses). The adjusted incidence rate ratio was 9.68 (95% CI = 3.46-34.98) for ChAdOx1 compared to mRNA-based vaccines and 3.14 (95% CI = 1.22-10.65) for females compared to non-females. In 26 of 45 patients with CVT (57.8%), VITT was graded highly probable. Interpretation: Given an incidence of 0.02 to 0.15 per 100,000 person-months for CVT in the general population, these findings point toward a higher risk for CVT after ChAdOx1 vaccination, especially for women.

Typical side effects of these vaccines were reported in clinical trials, with several thousand volunteers but without evidence of a vaccine-associated increase in thromboembolic events.

            "text": "Outside of the context of COVID-19 vaccination, cerebral venous thrombosis is a very rare disease with an incidence of about 0.22 to 1.75 per 100.00 person-years, based on data from several European countries, Australia, Iran, and Hong Kong. [7] [8] [9] Well-known risk factors are female sex, pregnancy, infections, and hypercoagulability. 10 Within hypercoagulability, hormone-related and genetic prothrombotic disorders are the most frequent causes. 11 Until the end of March 2021, the majority of persons vaccinated with ChAdOx1 in Germany were younger than 60 years. 6 ChAdOx1 was initially only recommended in Germany for persons younger than 65 years due to insufficient data on efficacy and safety among the elderly. In several European countries, cases of cerebral venous thrombosis were reported in temporal relationship with ChAdOx1 vaccine administration. An immune-mediated mechanism termed vaccineinduced thrombocytopenic thrombosis (VITT) has been suggested to underlie these serious adverse events. [12] [13] [14] At the beginning of March 2021, 30 venous thromboembolic events were reported to the European Medical Agency out of about 5 million persons who had received the ChAdOx1 vaccine. 15 At that time, the Danish National Patient Registry did not report a higher incidence of thromboembolic events in the Danish population but excluded cases of sinus-venous thrombosis from their analysis because of low incidence. 16 The aim of this report is to describe reported cases of cerebrovascular events in temporal relation to COVID-19 vaccination in Germany until April 14, 2021, based on a retrospective survey. We further aim at providing an incidence estimate of cerebral venous thrombosis within 31 days from first vaccine dose administration by vaccine type, age, and sex for 9 German states.",

The survey focused on the report of cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis and cerebral venous thrombosis events that had occurred within 31 days after COVID-19 vaccination in 2021. However, the questionnaire also allowed the reporting of other cerebrovascular events in possible temporal relationship with a COVID-19 vaccination. We combined cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis and cerebral venous thrombosis without the involvement of the vena cerebri magnahereafter referred to as cerebral sinus and/or venous thrombosis (CVT). Thirty-seven (93%) neurology departments at university hospitals (tertiary centers) and 75 (30%) neurology departments of nonuniversity hospitals responded (Fig 1) . We recorded information about the type of vaccination, symptoms, coagulation parameters, clinical course, and clinical outcomes. We developed a written protocol for data collection (see Table S2 ). The protocol was approved by the ethics committee (Vote-No. 142/21, Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty at RWTH Aachen University). Data protection and privacy compliance have been confirmed by the Data Protection Officer and the Information Security Officer of RWTH Aachen University Hospital. Coagulation parameters were also collected from the respective local laboratories. For a subgroup of patients, anti-heparin/platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibody/ polyanion-immunoglobulin G enzyme immunoassay and a platelet activation assay were performed in the laboratory of the Institute for Immunology and Transfusion Medicine at the University of Greifswald as described. 13 For the PF4 antibody results, we used information from the central laboratory in Greifswald, and only if it was missing, we considered test results if positive from the respective local hospitals.",

            "text": "Our descriptive study from Germany identified 62 vascular cerebrovascular adverse events in close temporal relationship with a COVID-19 vaccination, of which 45 cases were CVT. We estimated an incidence rate of CVT within 1 month from first dose administration of 1.52 per 100,000 person-months for the ChAdOx1 vaccine and 0.11 per 100,000 person-months for BNT162b2. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence rate of CVT has been estimated between 0.22-1.75 per 100,000 personyears, corresponding to 0.02-0.15 per 100,000 personmonths, in 4 European countries, Australia, Iran, and Hong Kong. [7] [8] [9] This corresponds to a >10-fold higher CVT incidence rate in patients who received a first ChAdOx1 vaccine shot compared with the highest estimate of CVT incidence rate from empirical data. A recent study using information from patient management software of general practitioners estimated that, in the period of 2017-2019, the incidence rate of CVT in Germany was 0.5 per 100,000 person-years, corresponding to 0.04 per 100,000 person-months. 19 In this article, we presented the frequency of CVT in terms of incidence rate. This choice was made to account for some individuals being at risk for <31 days due to administrative censorship, and to provide values comparable to published CVT incidence estimates in the general population. Summarizing the incidence with this metric also has limitations, namely, the assumption of a constant intensity of the phenomenon over time and a lower interpretability. To overcome the issue of limited interpretability, we would like to point out that under some assumptions the incidence rates approximate risks. For example, the reported incidence rate of 1.52 per 100,000 person-months after ChAdOx1 vaccination approximately corresponds to a risk of CVT within 1 month from first ChAdOx1 administration of 1.52 per 100,000 individuals.",

We confirm that CVT within 1 month from first dose administration occurs at a higher rate in females compared to non-females, accounting for age group and vaccine class. However, the rate of CVT occurring within 1 month from first dose administration, taking into account sex and vaccine class, did not differ statistically significantly between individuals younger than 60 years and individuals who are 60 years or older. 3.

Therefore, the risk of re-exposure to the vaccine in conjunction with the second vaccination cannot be estimated. Second, although the platelet activation of VITT is heparin-independent, it is unknown whether heparin therapy aggravates VITT in analogy to the clinical syndrome of autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Hence, nonheparin anticoagulants are recommended for the treatment of VITT-related CVT.

It also demonstrated that COVID-19 patients have a 2-week risk of CVT, which is 6 times higher than that of matched individuals vaccinated with a first dose of mRNA vaccines. 26 The decision on which vaccination strategy is best in a specific context depends not only on the risks of the vaccination but also on its benefits, with respect to possible and available alternative strategies.",
