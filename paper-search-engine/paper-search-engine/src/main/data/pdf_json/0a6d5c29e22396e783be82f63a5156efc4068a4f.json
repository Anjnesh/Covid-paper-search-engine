            "text": "Passing through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to treat neurological conditions is one of the main hurdles in modern medicine. Many drugs with promising in vitro profiles become ineffective in vivo due to BBB restrictive permeability. In particular, this includes drugs such as antiviral porphyrins, with the ability to fight brain-resident viruses causing diseases such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). In the last two decades, BBB shuttles, particularly peptide-based ones, have shown promise in carrying various payloads across the BBB. Thus, peptide\u2212drug conjugates (PDCs) formed by covalent attachment of a BBB peptide shuttle and an antiviral drug may become key therapeutic tools in treating neurological disorders of viral origin. In this study, we have used various approaches (guanidinium, phosphonium, and carbodiimide-based couplings) for on-resin synthesis of new peptide\u2212porphyrin conjugates (PPCs) with BBB-crossing and potential antiviral activity. After careful fine-tuning of the synthetic chemistry, DIC/oxyma has emerged as a preferred method, by which 14 different PPCs have been made and satisfactorily characterized. The PPCs are prepared by coupling a porphyrin carboxyl group to an amino group (either N-terminal or a Lys side chain) of the peptide shuttle and show effective in vitro BBB translocation ability, low cytotoxicity toward mouse brain endothelial cells, and low hemolytic activity. Three of the PPCs, MP-P5, P4-MP, and P4-L-MP, effectively inhibiting HIV infectivity in vitro, stand out as most promising. Their efficacy against other brain-targeting viruses (Dengue, Zika, and SARS-CoV-2) is currently under evaluation, with preliminary results confirming that PPCs are a promising strategy to treat viral brain infections.",

BBB is a natural protective structure that keeps the brain safe by specifically restricting the circulation of ions, molecules, and cells between the brain and bloodstream. Its unique structure, based on specialized endothelial cells, allows tight regulation of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis, which is critical for proper neuronal function, as well as protection from toxins, pathogens, inflammation, and so forth. In the last two decades, considerable efforts have been devoted to strategies enabling modulation and traversing of the BBB. 6\u221211 Among them, peptide-based BBB shuttles have proven particularly fruitful, with a number of sequences reported to effectively pass the BBB. 12\u221218 Recently, Neves et al. showed that some domains of the Dengue virus type 2 capsid protein (DEN2C) can become effective BBB shuttles. 19 One such sequence, after penetrating the brain by adsorptive-mediated transport (AMT), is rapidly excreted back into the bloodstream, acting as a trans-BBB vector that not only ferries drug payloads into but also flushes toxins out, preventing their brain accumulation. Thus, it would seem that, by proper choice of BBB peptide shuttles, PDCs with apposite drug cargoes can virtually be developed for a broad variety of conditions affecting the CNS.",

            "text": "In the complex scenario caused by the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as well as by other recent virus outbreaks, it is clear that effective antiviral agents will remain a main goal in drug development programs. A special challenge in this context is that of brain-penetrating viruses such as Zika, Dengue, SARS-CoV-2, or HIV, among others, all of which pose severe health risks. 20 \u221224 In particular, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) affect approximately half of the HIV-infected population. 25 HAND is caused by HIV entering the CNS at the early phase of infection, 26, 27 persisting in that system for decades and inducing decline in thinking or cognitive functions such as memory, reasoning, judgment, problem solving, and concentration. Studies have shown that the low BBB penetration of antiretroviral drugs was associated with continued HIV replication in the CNS and higher viral loads, precluding HAND effective treatment. 28 Porphyrins have been recently reported as efficient against enveloped viruses, 29 a group that includes the aforementioned brain-penetrating ones. Porphyrins are tetrapyrrole macrocycles, linked by methine bonds, with the four pyrrole nitrogens defining a metal ion coordination site involved in biological processes such as respiration and photosynthesis, 30 as well as in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. 31, 32 Their antiviral activity can be explained by two proposed mechanisms: (i) photoactivation, 33 a task not simple to perform when treating brain-resident viruses; (ii) viral envelope targeting, a primary mechanism in the absence of light, where virus infectivity is blocked by porphyrin local accumulation and perturbation of the viral lipid bilayer, an approach suitable to inhibiting brain-resident viruses. Unfortunately, like other antivirals, most porphyrins are unable to cross the BBB, which hinders their use against viral brain infections. 34, 35 We hypothesized that, by conjugating a porphyrin antiviral to a trans-BBB peptide shuttle, one might circumvent the challenges to fighting viral CNS diseases, in particular, HAND. Methods for peptide\u2212porphyrin conjugation, both in solution and in solid phase, have been described, 36 \u221238 with a growing consensus that, in terms of simplicity and expediency, on-resin conjugation offers palpable advantages over solution procedures. However, comparative studies showing how a given strategy (e.g., solution vs on-resin, coupling chemistries, etc.) is favored over others are lacking. Herein, we report the on-resin synthesis of various new peptide\u2212porphyrin conjugates (PPCs) with BBB-crossing ability and potential antiviral activity, and compare the effectiveness of activation methods (guanidinium, phosphonium, and carbodiimide) for coupling porphyrins to resin-bound peptides. In our study, we have used six peptide shuttles (P1\u2212P6, Table 1 ) and mesoporphyrin IX (MP) and protoporphyrin IX (PP) as antiviral payloads. Two shuttles, P1 and P3, have been reported as BBB-translocating, 19 another (P5) has been described as the \"negative image\" of P3, 39 i.e., the result of switching cationic residues (Lys, Arg) in P3 to anionic (Glu), thereby changing the overall positive charge in P3 to negative in P5; other entries in Table 1 (P2, P4, P6) are versions of P1, P3, and P5, respectively, elongated with an extra Lys residue to allow C-terminal conjugation (Supporting Information Scheme S1). In some instances, an 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (O 2 Oc) residue (abridged L, Table S1 ) is inserted between the peptide and the porphyrin units to ascertain if a spacer may modulate conjugate performance. In total, 14 novel conjugates have been obtained in high purity and satisfactorily characterized (Table S1, Figure S1 ). Three of them are effective in a BBB crossing cellular assay and display antiviral activity against HIV with low cytotoxicity.",

Conjugation between porphyrins and peptides has received considerable attention in the past decade due to the enhanced properties of the newly generated species, including the ability to overcome some of the obstacles related to porphyrin application. 37, 38, 40, 41 For example, peptide conjugation can improve poor water solubility of some porphyrins, reduce their aggregation tendency, and/or enhance porphyrin biological efficacy thanks to higher cell uptake of the conjugate vs the single porphyrin molecule. 37, 42, 43 In parallel with the broader biological applications of PPCs, the need for optimized approaches allowing quantitative conjugation at various sites has increased. So far, several strategies using a variety of chemistries have been adopted, neither giving clear advantages over others. 36 In our case, we opted for a solidphase approach, which is advantageous for its expediency. All PPCs in this work were made by an approach (Scheme 1 and Scheme S1) where a carboxyl of MP or PP is coupled to an amino group (N-terminal or Lys side chain) of the CPP while it remains on the solid support, followed by acidolytic deprotection and cleavage. Thus, by combining MP and PP with six CPPs (P1 to P6) and one linker (O 2 Oc), a total of 14 PPCs were prepared (Table S1, Figure S1 ).",

            "text": "In devising this approach, we were aware that both MP and PP, selected for their activity against enveloped viruses, 29 each have two carboxyl groups in very similar but not strictly identical environments; i.e., the carboxyl in blue in Scheme 1 (Table 1, Scheme S1) is nine carbons away from the nearest vinyl group (ethyl in MP), while the one in green is eight carbons removed, and so forth. Coupling of those slightly unsymmetric units to a homochiral peptide will result in a mixture of two diastereomers of such structural similarity to make resolution predictably difficult. Nevertheless, we deemed this route the most expeditious one, as the more orthodox course of selectively protecting each carboxyl in MP or PP appeared too arduous and of uncertain outcome. With the above caveat in mind, we actively searched for evidence of diastereomers in the end products. LC-MS inspection by carefully chosen conditions (different ion-pairing reagents, 13 C-HSQC spectra ( Figure 1 ). These two sets of signals can be assigned to the two putative diastereomers. That only the 1 H and 13 C chemical shifts of the residues closer to the MP moiety are affected ( Figure 1 , Table S2 , Figures S4 and  S5 ) is understandable by the very similar chemical environments in the two diastereomers. It was not possible to assign each set of signals to a specific diastereomer, because no distinctive NOE cross-peaks could be observed. In any case, the fact that the two sets of cross-peaks show approximately equal intensities indicates that the coupling reaction occurs with no regioselectivity. Another concern of this work, of more practical consequence, was finding optimal conditions for high PPC yields by an on-resin approach. To this end, we explored three activation methods: (i) DIC/oxyma, (ii) guanidinium (TBTU or HATU), or (iii) phosphonium (PyBOP). Depending on the protocol, various reaction times were examined ( Table 2) . For DIC/oxyma, longer times (up to 3 h) were preferable, while couplings mediated by more reactive guanidinium or phosphonium species were completed within 1 h. Optimized conditions were first developed for N-terminal conjugation, then extended to side chain conjugation (Scheme S1). The influence of solid support (ChemMatrix or Protide) and porphyrin concentration (0.02 vs 0.05 M) was also assessed.",

The optimized 3h+1h conditions afforded almost quantitative yields too in the sidechain coupling of MP or PP to P2, thus evidencing that coupling efficiency was independent of amino group position. For MP, neutralization of the hydrochloride helped avoid sluggish couplings ( Figure S6 ).

As mentioned before, porphyrins are broad-spectrum antivirals against enveloped viruses, with HIV as an example. 29 (Table 3 , Figure S7 ). The remaining conjugates did not inhibit HIV at non-cytotoxic concentrations (data not shown). Nonconjugated porphyrins caused no significant inhibition of HIV infectivity, in agreement with results in the absence of photoactivation. 33 Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that CPP conjugation improves porphyrin efficacy by increasing membrane affinity and/or internalization, critical for the PPCs antiviral activity, 47, 48 in agreement with the PPCs internalization results for bEnd.3 cells ( Figure S8 ).",

All conjugates were well characterized, with purity >90%, displaying a single elution peak in RP-HPLC analyses. However, due to the chemical (Table 1) were built on Rink amide ChemMatrix (0.5 mmoL/g) or Protide resins (0.54 mmol/g), using Fmoc chemistry, at 0.1 mmoL scale in either Prelude (Gyros, Tucson AZ) or Liberty Blue (CEM, Matthews, NC) instruments. Side chain protections were tertbutyl (Ser, Thr), trityl (Gln), Boc (Lys, Trp), and 2,2,4,6,7pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Arg). In P2, P4, and P6 syntheses, the extra Lys at the C-terminal was protected with selectively removable monomethoxytrityl (Mmt). In MP-L-P3, P4-L-MP, PP-L-P3, and P4-L-PP sequences (Table S1) , the O 2 Oc spacer was coupled manually by DIC/oxyma and coupling checked by the Kaiser test. 49 After completing each synthesis, a resin test cleavage (RTC) to check identity and purity was performed. Briefly, ca. Figure 2 shows representative HPLC traces of these trial runs from which optimal conditions were derived for the PP (DIC/ oxyma, 3h+1h) and MP (DIC/oxyma/DIPEA, 3h+1h) conjugations to the (Lys) side-chain of P2-resin, and then also generalized to other entries on Table 2 . When peptide sequences with C-terminal Lys were used (P2, P4, P6), the side-chain Mmt group was selectively removed prior to porphyrin coupling by 1% TFA in DCM (5 \u00d7 1 min) followed by DCM washes; the cycle was repeated until no more yellow color (presence of Mmt) was observed. The resin was then neutralized for 30 s with 5% DIPEA in DCM, and porphyrin coupling was performed as above. In RTCs for these trial conjugations, cold diethyl ether (which might partially solubilize conjugates) was replaced by drying of the solution under a N 2 stream. The residue was then taken up in 1.5 mL of 15% MeCN/H 2 O and analyzed by LC-MS (see below). Conversion rates were calculated from integrated peak areas of conjugate and starting peptide in the LC chromatograms.",

After 45 h, TZM-bl cell infection was quantified through luciferase reporter-gene expression levels, under the control of an HIV-1 TAT-dependent LTR promoter 57 using the Luc-Screen luciferase chemiluminescence detection system. Luminescence was measured in an Infinite M200 microplate reader from Tecan (Mannedorf, Switzerland). Cells were considered to be infected if the respective luminescence intensity (L) was 5-fold higher than that of control cells unexposed to virus. Titration was performed with at least four replicates to allow accurate estimation of TCID 50 in viral supernatants.",
