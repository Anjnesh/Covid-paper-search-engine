Methods: Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and MedRix were searched for potentially relevant articles. All included papers were assessed for the quality using modified Jadad scale and Newcastle-Ottawa scale for randomized controlled trial (RCT) and non -RCT, respectively. We used a Q test and Egger test to assess the heterogeneity and publication bias among studies, respectively. Mortality rates between patients treated with standard treatment and standard treatment with CCP were compared using a Z test. Results: A total of 12 papers consisting of three cross-sectional studies, one prospective study, five retrospective studies, and three RCT studies were included in our analysis. Of them, a total of 1,937 patients treated with CCP and 3,405 patients without CCP were included. The risk of mortality was 1.92-fold higher in patients without CCP compared to patients treated with CCP (OR: 1.92; 95%CI: 1.33, 2.77; p=0.0005). In severe COVID-19 sub-group analysis, we found that patients without CCP had a 1.32 times higher risk of mortality than those treated with CCP (OR: 1.32; 95%CI: 1.09, 1.60; p=0.0040). Conclusions: CCP, as adjunctive therapy, could reduce the mortality rate among COVID-19 patients.",

Initially, it was used to treat diphtheria and other infectious diseases such as scarlet fever and pertussis. 10 Moreover, due to its good efficacy, this therapy was also used for the management of Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 11 In patients with MERS, SARS, and Ebola, the clinical improvement and reduced mortality rate were observed in patients receiving CCP compared to patients without CPP. 12 However, the efficacy of CCP against COVID-19 is conflicting. Furthermore, the previous meta-analyses resulted in inconclusive findings due to the lack of structured methodology. Therefore, a holistic meta-analysis is needed to provide insight into the clinical efficacy of CCP for the management of COVID-19.",

Our current findings are consistent with the results of previous meta-analyses. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] The theory underlying the mechanism of CCP in COVID-19 patients remains open to controversy. Briefly, plasma transfer is the potential aspect that bridges the CCP and the reduced risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Plasma consists of various immunity components, including antibodies, anti-inflammatory cytokines, clotting and or anti-clotting factors, albumin, and protein C and S. 33, 34 It is believed that CCP in COVID-19 may modulate the immune response through antiviral effects and has immunomodulatory effects. 35 Antiviral effects of CCP may occur through neutralizing antibodies, and it was reported that IgG and IgM anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were the primary isotype antibodies identified from COVID-19 patients treated with CCP. 36 This humoral immune response may inhibit protein S of SARS-CoV-2. 37 Thereafter, they may exert the protective effects against COVID-19. The immunomodulatory effects of CCP may occur through the neutralization of cytokines and complements. 35, 38 These effects may inhibit the overactive immune system, including cytokine storm, complement activation, and hypercoagulable state regulation. 39 These mechanisms may be responsible for causing clinical improvement of COVID-19 patients. Of them, it was considered that immunoglobulin transfer is the essential factor in modulating the protective effect of CCP. 40 In SARS and influenza, it was reported that immunoglobulin transfer plays a vital role in governing clinical improvement. 9, 11 Moreover, in MERS, the CCP administration with the titers of antibodies 1:80 provided a significant immune response, and the titers of antibodies 1:40 did not provide a similar response. 41 Additionally, in Ebola, MERS, and SARS, the antibodies from the CCP may bind to the CD4 binding site on the viral envelope, and therefore may reduce the viral load and the risk of infection of the new cells. 42 It was also supported by previous studies that antibody titers from CCP donors also governed the clinical improvement of COVID-19 patients treated with CCP, 43, 44 suggesting that antibody transfer might influence the outcomes of clinical improvement.",

            "text": "The phrase has been revised.There are two dots in the end of the second sentence of the results section in the abstract. Response: We have revised the sentence.In the introduction, the following sentence could be expanded: \"the mortality rate of COVID-19 remains increased over the periods\". Please, focus on the literature you cited and be specific as possible. For instance, some reports show the opposite, that is, that treatment has improved so the mortality rate has decreased. The authors' very own findings point to lower OR for death among those treated with CCP. Response: The sentence has been revised.Albeit it is true that the solidarity trial showed little efficacy of the drugs mentioned in the introduction, a robust finding was found in severe patients that were treated with dexamethasone. Response: We only reported the findings of the trial. The trial did not include dexametasone.Would you please give more information on clinical improvement of the diseases treated with CCP cited in the second paragraph (introduction, ref. n. 12)? Response: The clinical improvement indicated the improvement of disease manifestation.The following sentence needs a few supporting references: \"However, the efficacy of CCP against COVID-19 is conflicting\". Response: In this sentence, we tried to explained that, among all included studies in our analysis, some studies found the efficacy of CCP for treating COVID-19, while other studies failed to clarify the efficacy. The references were provided in the results section.I would suggest the authors to remove the word \"holistic\" when presenting their goal. Response: the word \"holistic\" has been removed.When presenting the eligibility criteria, I was wondering why pre-post comparisons were excluded. Would be worth it to justify this choice. Response: The reason why pre-post comparisons were excluded from our study is we considered that the outcomes of therapy might have high risk of bias due to the final outcomes were affected by CCP or other medications. I would change this sentence \"If the disagreement was found, we performed a discussion to resolve the disagreement\" into \"Disagreements were resolved in group discussions\". Also, did you ask for an external judge to assist in the discussion of disagreements? Or a consensus approach was used? This is unclear. Response: The sentence has been revised.There is a typo in the section describing the outcome variable (e.i. mild and severe). Please, correct to \"i.e.\"; Also, the outcome variables could be more clear. Do you mean \"the number or COVID-19 patients treated with CCP\"? Response: The sentence has been revised.In the section \"Heterogeneity and potency of bias across the studies\", please be clear/complete in the following sentence \"a random-effect model was applied to assess the Association\u2026\". Association between what? Response: The sentence has been revised.This sentence needs more information: \"In the present meta-analysis, we only calculated the model of the case (standard treatment and CCP) vs. control (standard treatment only) and therefore might provide a better correlation\". Would you please justify why your approach provides better 'correlation'? Response: We considered that the design of standard treatment and CCP vs. standard treatment only, and the patients were followed up after the periods might have better efficacy than the design of pre-post comparisons. In the design of pre-post comparisons, the outcomes of therapy might have high risk of bias due to the final outcomes were affected by CCP or other medications.Please, double check the comprehensiveness of Table 2 . The table is supposed to present previous meta-analyses and some of the studies included there were judged to not calculate data synthesis. However, I see that some studies are only systematic reviews, such as Rajendran and collaborators. Response: The sentence has been revised.Supplementary file 2 has some typos (https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/SUPPLEMENTARY_FILE_2_THE_ASSOCIATION_BETWEEN_CONVALESCEN including \"Funnel plot of tha association\". Would you please correct it? Response: The supplementary file 2 has been revised.The supplementary Prisma checklist contains information not covered in the study. For instance, the authors said that the systematic review registration number has been given in the abstract, albeit I was not able to find it. This checklist also asks the authors to be explicit about the language of papers under \"eligibility\". This should be made clear in the text and in the supplementary checklist. Item 19 of the same checklist asks that authors \"present data on risk of bias of each study\". I could not locate this in the text. Please, revise this item. Response: The study registration is on process. The risk of bias was assessed using Egger test. The quality of each study was assessed using Newcastle-ottawa scale and Modified Jadad scale. ",
