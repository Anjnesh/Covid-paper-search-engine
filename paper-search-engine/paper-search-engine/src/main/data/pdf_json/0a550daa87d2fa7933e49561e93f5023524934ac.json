The researcher tried to ask people from different age groups, gender, and regions to participate and distribute the survey to all of their contacts. The survey was composed of two sections. The first section included questions about participants' sociodemographic characteristics, including sex (male or female), age in years, education (secondary school, diploma, university graduate, or post-graduate), income (<6000, 6000-12,000, 12,001-18,000, 18,001-24,000, or >24,000 Saudi Riyal/month (1 Saudi Riyal = 0.27 US Dollar)), nationality (Saudi or non-Saudi), history of COVID-19 infection (yes or no), history of chronic diseases (yes or no), and history of allergies (yes or no). The second section included a question about the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine: \"Do you intend to receive the COVID-19 vaccine?\", and the responses were \"I have received the vaccine\", \"I intend to receive the vaccine\", \"I do not intend to receive the vaccine\", and \"not sure\". It also included six statements about COVID-19 vaccine knowledge and five statements about COVID-19 vaccine concerns. The knowledge statements were constructed based on a previous study [25] , as follows: \"I know people who are not allowed to receive COVID-19 vaccines\", \"I know the possible side effects of COVID-19 vaccines\", \"I know the steps that have been taken to test the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines\", \"I know the steps that have been taken to test the safety of COVID-19 vaccines\", \"I know the opinion of scientists about COVID-19 vaccines\", and \"I know the opinion of trusted health organizations about COVID-19 vaccines\". The concern statements were constructed based on previous studies [12, 26] , as follows: \"COVID-19 vaccines have serious adverse effects\", \"Drug companies are interested in COVID-19 vaccine sales only\", \"The healthcare system is not trustworthy regarding COVID-19 vaccines\", \"COVID-19 vaccines are ineffective\", and \"COVID-19 vaccines are not tested enough on people\". Respondents had to express whether they agreed with the knowledge and concern statements on a Likert scale from one to five, with a total score of 5-30 for knowledge and 5-25 for concern. Higher scores indicated higher levels of knowledge and concern.",

In agreement, previous national studies have shown increased COVID-19 vaccine refusal rates among those with concerns about vaccine safety [21, 22] . Additionally, a study conducted on people from two countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region with similar cultural backgrounds (Jordan and Kuwait) reached the same conclusion [35] .

Individuals with high perceived threat and risk appraisal were shown in previous research to be more willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine [37] . Further, non-Saudi residents have been known to share houses and even rooms with each other, which increases their possibility of contracting the virus. The high perceived risk among non-Saudi residents, due to their need to work and share houses, may explain why they are more willing than Saudi citizens to receive the vaccine.",

Online surveys can hide non-response bias since respondents might have different sociodemographic characteristics and, consequently, different vaccine refusal and hesitancy rates compared with non-respondents. For example, respondents to online surveys, in general, tend to be younger than non-respondents [38] . Young age in this study was associated with vaccine refusal and hesitancy; thus, the generalization of our results to the whole population should be made cautiously. Second, although we investigated most potential risk factors for COVID-19 vaccine refusal and hesitancy, we believe that other cultural and religious variables could have played a role in the participants' decision on vaccination. A qualitative assessment of such variables is, therefore, highly warranted. Third, the knowledge scale used in this study was based on a previous study and not validated as a result of the limited number of studies on the topic when proposing the study, so the scale needs to be validated.",
