The Center for Autism Services and Transition (CAST) clinic was developed in 2014 using feedback from parents of adults on the autism spectrum and patient-centered medical home principles. We evaluated the reach of CAST's services. As of January 2021, 858 patients were seen in CAST. Many continue to receive primary care from the CAST clinic. The program has undergone staffing changes but continues to accept new patients. We have added services such as \"happy visits,\" pre-procedure videos, and telehealth visits. CAST provides one example of how to improve primary care for adults on the autism spectrum. More research is needed to assess the effectiveness of the CAST model.",

The transition to adulthood in general and from pediatric to adult health care specifically are challenging for many young adults (Bonnie et al., 2015) . The legal changes that begin at age 18 such as only sharing medical information with the patient, which are meant to protect a patient's privacy, can also create communication barriers for young people whose parents are regularly involved in conversations about medical care, and this is especially problematic for young people on the autism spectrum (Cheak-Zamora & Teti, 2015) . Additionally, young adults on the autism spectrum have to navigate disruption of support services upon exiting the school system and changes in insurance eligibility that occur between the ages of 19 and 26, depending upon the health insurance they have (Okumura et al., 2015) .",

The barriers to care have been identified, with patient level barriers such as communication skills, sensory sensitivity, information processing difficulties and lack of healthcare self-management skills; provider level barriers such as lack of knowledge about autism; and system level barriers including availability of support and accessibility of facilities (Nicolaidis et al., 2013; Raymaker et al., 2017; Saqr et al., 2018) . However, very little has been published that directly addresses how to improve primary care for adults on the autism spectrum or their transition to adult health care. Models for providing care for children with developmental disabilities, including autism, emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary specialist teams (Bolger et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2019; Thibadeau et al., 2020) , which have not been consistently replicated in adult care (Bolger et al., 2017; Thibadeau et al., 2020) . In some cases, generalists based in adult care settings have found strategies to address the needs of adults with developmental disabilities during their transition to adult care (Hart et al., 2019) . Detailed descriptions of how they are able to achieve this are lacking in the literature.",

New visits have remained extended at 60 min to allow time for the provider to get to know the patient and family a bit better and to allow for any time the patient might need to adapt to the new environment of the clinic. Our initial concerns about decreased physician reimbursement were alleviated both by shortening follow-up visits and by using time-based billing for longer visits.

Since it began in April 2014, the goal for the CAST program has been to provide high-quality care for adolescents and young adults on the autism spectrum as they move from pediatric to adult care. The program was intentionally based in a primary care setting so that CAST patients and their families would have a first contact point for autism-specific as well as general health needs and be able to have not only regularly scheduled visits but also sick visits in a familiar setting. CAST includes dedicated staff and extended initial appointment times to help ensure that CAST patients are as comfortable as possible when being seen there. Donor support and grant funding has allowed for CAST to offer an array of supports beyond those typically included in primary care, such as longer initial appointments, a full-time nurse, social work at times, procedure videos for patients to view in advance of visits, and educational sessions for patients and families. This evaluation of the CAST program shows that CAST has continued to be utilized by adolescents and young adults on the autism spectrum and their families. The program has seen 858 unique patients since it started in April 2014 and its three current providers continue to accept new patients. Monthly visit numbers show that patients continue to be seen regularly in the program.",

We do not track who is choosing to watch the videos, which are freely available on the CAST clinic web site and YouTube\u00ae. That being said, we have a few thoughts as to why the provider-focused videos may have been viewed more. We did note that when some searches are done on YouTube\u00ae, the provider-focused video is listed first, and so this may prompt more views of those videos. We also thought it might be possible that patients and families are watching both videos while providers are only watching the provider-focused video. Finally, we have shared the videos at various lectures and national meetings, which may be prompting others to use the provider-focused videos in their own care settings or with their own trainees.",

As Fig. 2 shows, psychiatric visits were held regularly when a psychiatrist was available and often provided care focused on management of anti-psychotics and other psychotropic medications. While dedicated social work visits were not as common, social work support has allowed CAST patients and their families to address a number of needs, particularly for those related to navigating applications for support services after school services have ended. We recently hired a dedicated social worker to address these needs more systematically for CAST patients. This hiring was delayed due to a hiring freeze at our institution related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The smaller team had less capacity to think about the program's growth and strategies for improving it. This highlights how small teams are at risk of being disrupted by staffing changes. Despite the changes in staffing, the program continues to accept new patients, highlighting the need for primary care access for adults on the autism spectrum.",

When implementing a program like CAST, the financial impacts of decisions must be considered. In our experience, utilizing time-based billing for longer visits can help augment reimbursement. Money from a private donor has supported salaries for support staff (RN, social work) and initial losses in physician revenue. If this funding were not available, other options would include increasing billable visits by the social worker, although this would limit social work contribution to primarily mental health counseling. Early in CAST's evolution, we utilized a clinic registration staff for some of our pre-visit assessment phone calls. If well trained, this can be an effective and less expensive option, but it did limit the ability to triage that comes with a registered nurse. Unfortunately, happy visits are not a billable encounter, which has limited our ability to employ them more broadly.",

It differs from a model often used in pediatric care, where multiple specialists focused specifically on a particular developmental disorder provide care for just that patient population in a specialized setting (Bolger et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2019; Thibadeau et al., 2020) .

We acknowledge that CAST may not directly translate into a general primary care office due to the fact that the program has relied at least in part on grant and donor funding. We still feel that the strategies used within the CAST program provide tools that can be considered for use by other providers who are caring for a similar patient population. In particular, the modifications to the visit routine like patients waiting in the car rather than the waiting room and delaying blood pressure measurement are relatively simple to implement. In addition, while extending visits routinely can be problematic, having patients on the autism spectrum schedule either as the first or last patient of the day can give a provider more flexibility in their time with the patient and family without requiring major system changes. We would like to reiterate that, while the physicians in the CAST program are board certified in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, the tools and strategies described here are applicable to all providers across multiple specialties seeing adults on the autism spectrum as patients. This likely includes every provider, since about 1 in 100 adults are on the autism spectrum (Baxter et al., 2015; Brugha et al., 2011; Dietz et al., 2020) .",

In particular, because CAST was built into a larger primary care practice and patients from CAST were added to the primary care panels of the participating physicians, CAST did not require extensive resources from the hospital the way that a dedicated clinic with its own physical space and physicians would have. Since the resource output from the hospital for the program was smaller, it was easier to gain support from hospital leaders and administrators. This evaluation is limited by the use of retrospective data collection. We have presented the data we have available regarding the reach of CAST. Some data, such as the number of families who have attended educational sessions and the identity of those viewing our procedure videos, were not collected and are not available. The lack of available data also limits the types of analyses that we can do. This program is running at one academic medical center, which may limit generalizability. The development of CAST was limited by the fact that we did not include patients on the autism spectrum in the initial focus group. We have since elicited feedback from patients about the program (Hand et al., 2020) . However, more proactive outreach to patients earlier on may have improved our initial implementation and evaluation.",
