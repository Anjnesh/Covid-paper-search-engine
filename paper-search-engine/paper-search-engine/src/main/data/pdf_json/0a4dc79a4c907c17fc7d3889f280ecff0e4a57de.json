This paper presents a method of using low cost wirelessly connected carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) sensors to measure the effects of properly and improperly worn face masks on the concentration distribution of exhaled breath around the face. Four types of face masks are used in two indoor environment scenarios. CO 2 as a proxy for exhaled breath is being measured with the Sensirion SCD30 CO 2 sensor, and data are being transferred wirelessly to a base station. The exhaled CO 2 is measured in four directions at various distances from the head of the subject, and interpolated to create spatial heat maps of CO 2 concentration. Statistical analysis using the Friedman's analysis of variance (ANOVA) test is carried out to determine the validity of the null hypotheses (i.e., distribution of the CO 2 is same) between different experiment conditions. Results suggest CO 2 concentrations vary little with the type of mask used; however, improper use of the face mask results in statistically different CO 2 spatial distribution of concentration. The use of low cost sensors with a visual interpolation tool could provide an effective method of demonstrating the importance of proper mask wearing to the public.",

Wearing face coverings in public settings has also been the centre of political debate and discussions about human freedom. Since the beginning of the 2020 pandemic, there has been discussion on the efficacy of face coverings and masks. However, recent studies show clear benefits in reducing transmission [1] [2] [3] [4] , and the use of face coverings has been accepted by the wider scientific community. In one study, [5] , two hairdressers both tested positive for COVID-19 and wore a double layer face mask while working. They did not pass the disease to their clients, while their family members did contract it. In [6] , the authors compared 200 countries and concluded that in the countries where face masks were not recommended, the per-capita mortality increased each week by a factor of 1.619, or 61.9%. On the other hand, in countries recommending masks, the per-capita mortality tended to increase each week by just 16.2%. This, however, was based on the assumption that wearing face masks properly was adhered to or enforced. Another study [7] examined the infection rate in 15 states plus Washington D.C. after the government mandated the use of face masks in public and concluded that the COVID-19 growth rate declined by a maximum of 2 percentage points per day in these states. Evidence is also provided in a laboratory study [8] , where animal experiments were conducted to show a barrier made from typical mask material reduced transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

During normal breathing, speech, coughing or sneezing, respiratory particles are exhaled over a wide range of sizes from under 1 \u00b5m to over 100 \u00b5m in diameter. Some of the larger droplets are visible and deposit rapidly due to gravity, while the much finer aerosols are carried in the exhaled breath and room ventilation, and remain in the air for long periods of time. Respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through deposition of larger droplets onto mucous membranes, or when aerosols are breathed in by another person. In a recent work, the plume of exhaled air is visualised using imaging techniques [9] , demonstrating the influence of a face covering on the direction and extent of the plume.",

CO 2 is metabolically produced by humans during respiration, and hence can be used as a proxy for the exhaled breath plume. The concentration levels of CO 2 in indoor environments depend on the building occupancy and ventilation system. With poor ventilation, high CO 2 concentration can remain in the air [10] with a steady increase in concentration over time. We explore the use of CO 2 sensor measurements as a simple approach to characterise the distribution of exhaled breath and the influence of a face mask. While CO 2 is not representative of risk associated with large respiratory particles, it is a good proxy for the smallest aerosol particles, which could potentially lead to airborne virus transportation. CO 2 concentration has been used as a proxy for airborne infection transmission modelling in a number of studies [11, 12] . Moreover, the effects of high level CO 2 on human health and cognition are reported in [13] [14] [15] .",

There are observable differences between the average readings obtained from the sensor at the front, in a ventilated and unventilated environment, for both the nose out and nose in case. The range of CO 2 concentration at the sensor in front of the face is wide for the nose out case as shown by the error bars. The minimum values are low because the sensor is at baseline (700-800 ppm) just before the experiment starts (which is in fact the case for all experiments) and it reaches a maximum value during normal speech (2000-2200 ppm). The extremely high CO 2 observed at a short distance is independent of the ventilation in the room. This is observed repeatedly with the different types of masks. The left and right sensor show little to no increase in average CO 2 concentration compared to baseline concentration. The error bars are also very close to the average values in all four cases for the left and right sensors. Interestingly, the sensor placed at the top of the head shows high CO 2 concentration when the mask is properly worn with the nose in; this is due to the exhaled breath while being obstructed by the mask in the forward direction escapes in the cracks between the face and the mask and rises upwards due to it being warmer. As will be seen in the subsequent figures, this phenomenon is observed with every mask. At a distance of 60 cm the maximum CO 2 concentration drops significantly by about \u223c1000 ppm at the front sensors, this is due to the rapid dilution of the exhaled air plume. There is still some difference between the proper and improper use of the mask; however, the difference is not as pronounced as at 30 cm. Similar to the 30 cm case, the left and right sensors do not register any high CO 2 values. The sensors above the head also show decreased CO 2 concentration for all four cases. At 90 cm the obtained results are similar to the 60 cm case with only slight increase in the readings from the sensor above the head. Figure 5a -c show the test results for the surgical type mask. Results are similar to the single and double layer mask. Interestingly, evident from the narrow error bars, when these masks are properly worn, the measured CO 2 displays negligible change from the baseline value. This is the same for all the mask types, an indication that all these masks have a comparable effect on the exhaled breath plume when worn correctly. Figure 6a -c presents the results for the KN95 rated mask, here again the same pattern as for the other masks is followed and the results are consistent. For comparison, the average CO 2 concentration when no mask is worn is shown in Figure 7 . As expected, at 30 cm, high CO 2 concentration is observed by the sensor located at the front and above the head. While there is little impact on the left and right sensors. Relatively lower CO 2 values are observed at 60 cm and 90 cm.",

In this study, the natural neighbour interpolation (NNI) [21] is used to interpolate and generate a smooth continuous surface from the distributed sensor readings. NNI is a local interpolation technique, which is based on the Voronoi tessellation of the data points or sensor readings. The Voronoi tessellation is a set of tiles (or polygons) where each tile surrounds one data point. Every point in a tile is closer to its corresponding data point than it is to any other data point. After the Voronoi tessellation is constructed, the NNI works on introduction of query points (non-measured points) which generate their own tiles, thus establishing a link between the non-measured and sensed points. The area of the new tile captures a segment of the old tiles and the interpolated value of the new tile is a weighted average of the neighbouring points, see [21] for detailed description. Let point x be the query point with N neighbours for which we wish to predict the CO 2 concentration\u0108 x , then by denoting A(x i ) as the captured area from the neighbouring tile i and A(x) as the total area of the tile corresponding to query point x, the interpolated CO 2 is given b\u0177",

Furthermore, to provide a complete picture, the estimates at locations outside the convex hull of the sensors are extrapolated using linear extrapolation. Figures 8-11 present a top down view of the interpolated heat maps of the CO 2 concentration. This 2D interpolation does not contain the measurement at the sensor above the head. The head is at location (0, 90) cm, while readings are taken from sensor located at (0, 0), (0, 30), (0, 60), (0, 120), (0, 150), (0, 180), (30, 90), (30, 60), (30, 90). It is noted that to avoid sensor error and offset between sensors, the same three sensors are used at the nine locations sequentially to obtain the results. The source CO 2 is taken by placing the CO 2 sensor in close proximity to the face (almost touching) and data recorded when the mask is worn properly and also when the nose is out. Figures 8-11 show the heat map of CO 2 distribution with proper and improper use of a single layer fabric, double layer fabric, surgical type and KN95 rated masks, respectively, in the unventilated setting. Snapshots at 10, 40 and 80 s are shown. When the mask is properly worn, the CO 2 concentration is far less than when the mask is worn improperly. Moreover, the distance travelled by the plume is longer with improper mask use. It is interesting to note that when measuring for the source CO 2 concentration close to the face with the mask properly worn, the sensor did register higher CO 2 , as can be seen in the first rows of Figures 8-11 . Whether this is a result of some CO 2 escaping the mask material or through the cracks between the mask and face is unclear. ",

This is indeed expected and is evident from the bar charts in Figures 3-6 . On the other hand, for the same environment, the null hypothesis is not rejected for the left and right sensors at all distances, except for the left sensor at 30 cm. Again evident from the average bar charts presented earlier, significant difference in the average values is not observed on the left and right sides. Thus, exercising improper use of a mask does not have an impact on CO 2 concentration on either side of the face. As pointed out, Friedman's test on the left sensor at 30 cm did reject the null hypothesis however this is attributed to the negligible variation in the left (and also the right) sensor, which in fact does not register any increase in CO 2 values above the baseline. This is evident from the narrow error bars over the left and right sensors in Figures 3-6 . This results in the statistical test misinterpreting the small inherent bias in the individual sensors as the basis for rejecting the null hypothesis. For the ventilated case, only the left sensor at 30 cm is not rejected while the null hypothesis for the rest of the cases is rejected. For the left and right sensors, statistical test results should not be accepted on face value and should be analysed in conjunction with Figures 3-6 , where it is seen that the left and right sensors register slightly different gas concentrations due to sensor bias and the same explanation as for the left and right sensors in the non-ventilated case applies for the ventilated case. The two smallest p-values are obtained when comparing proper and improper mask use at 30 cm in front of the face in both ventilated and non-ventilated environments. This signifies a substantial difference in observed CO 2 measurements in these cases. ",

The findings also have potential implications for low cost approaches to demonstrate the importance of mask fit for public use. The use of spatially distributed CO 2 sensors with a graphical interpolation interface may be an effective approach for training and education in the importance of correct mask wearing.

The unventilated case is showing lower mean values compared to the ventilated case. This phenomenon is not repeated by the other masks or this mask at other distances, and so potentially reflects experimental error. On the other hand, the sensor above the head again showed higher CO 2 concentration, this is pronounced in the nose in (proper mask use) case, in which the exhaled air is blocked by the mask in the front and escapes to the top.Figure 4b,c show similar results to the 30 cm case.",
