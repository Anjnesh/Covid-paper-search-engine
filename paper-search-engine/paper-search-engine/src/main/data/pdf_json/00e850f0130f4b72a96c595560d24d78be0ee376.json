Our results require cautious interpretation. Our initial analysis found evidence of a modest increase in the rate of change in median daily distance travelled after participants received their first dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but when restricting our analysis to periods of lockdown, we did not find evidence of a difference in mobility following one vaccination dose. On balance, our results do not provide evidence that people increase the rate of their movements following first dose vaccination as they are consistent with both an increase and decrease in movement after vaccination and suggest that any change in mobility post vaccination is likely to be modest.",

Not only does this improve accuracy over other methods of distance estimation by using the GPS system (as compared to cellular location), it also reduces recall bias when compared with using self reported data. Our interrupted time series study design controls for non time varying confounders as the same individual's data are considered before and after vaccination. Our studies' sample size means that we may be underpowered to detect small changes in mobility, particularly when restricting to the period of national lockdown. Our GPS collection was automated, but could be switched on and off by participants and is more likely to have been switched off on days when participants stayed at home. The use of the app in this way would result in our analysis over estimating the median distance travelled per day, through the non-reporting of GPS data (e.g. switching the app off) on days when participants stayed at home. Due to technological requirements of tracking applications, results were skewed towards those who had access to a smartphone and were able to contribute their data plan towards research activities, leading to low initial uptake rate. With a draining effect on battery life from the GPS app used, the drop-out rate from the tracker cohort of Virus Watch was relatively high. People taking part in Virus Watch are self-selecting and motivated to contribute to COVID-19 research and therefore their movement patterns may not be generalisable to all vaccinated groups.",

It is also possible that other time varying confounders such as weather changes may affect the findings, with participants increasing mobility during this same time period post-vaccination as a result of improvements in weather. Whilst previous research found that nearly half of those who were vaccinated (after one dose) met with others outside their households or support bubbles (4), our findings provide a mixed picture about movement after the first dose of vaccination and we find no evidence of an increase when we conduct our analyses during periods of national movement restrictions.",
