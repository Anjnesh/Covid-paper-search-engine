Almost 20% of women will elect surgical correction of this condition by age 85. Removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) with concomitant vaginal vault suspension is a longstanding practice in POP surgery to address apical (uterine) prolapse. Yet, contemporary evidence on the merits of this approach relative to preservation of the uterus through suspension is needed to better inform surgical decision-making by patients and their healthcare providers. The objective of this study is to evaluate POP-specific health outcomes and service utilization of women electing uterine suspension compared to those electing hysterectomy and vaginal vault suspension for POP surgery up to 1-year post-surgery.",

The primary outcome is anatomic failure to correct POP, and secondary outcomes include changes in positioning of pelvic structures, re-treatment, subjective report of bulge symptoms, pelvic floor distress and impact, sexual function, and health service use. Data will be analyzed using inverse probability weighting of propensity scores and generalized linear models.",

            "text": "Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a disorder where one or more pelvic organs (i.e., bladder, uterus, small bowel, rectum) descend from their normal position and bulge into or through the vagina. 1 Symptoms include sensations of pressure or pain in the pelvis and/or vagina, urinary incontinence, difficulties with defecation, and uncomfortable intercourse. 2 Major risk factors for POP are older age, high body mass index, increasing parity, and number of vaginal deliveries. 3 POP greatly affects women's well-being, and is associated with a diminished quality of life, 4 increased risk of depression and anxiety, 5,6 and negative body image. 7,8 Women with POP often report self-consciousness, isolation, and avoidance of sexual intimacy due to embarrassment or shame. 7,8 Estimated prevalence of POP is 3-6% when based on patient-reported symptoms but up to 50% when based on vaginal examination, 9,10 and 12-19% of women will have POP surgery by age 85. 11,12 Initial surgery is not always successful, and around 19% of women with prior POP surgery undergo re-operation. 11 POP surgery traditionally involves removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) to access pelvic ligaments and tissues for suspension of the vagina, even in cases when the uterus is not among the prolapsed organs. 13 Data from British Columbia, Canada indicates that POP is the most common indication for vaginal (72%) and laparoscopic (43%) benign hysterectomies. 14 Inclusion of hysterectomy in POP surgery is entrenched in medical culture, such that the essential role of uterus removal in surgery success has mainly been investigated in the last decade. As understanding of the pathophysiology of POP has improved, clinicians have acknowledged that the uterus may act as a \"keystone\" of support in the pelvis; removal may thus have unintended consequences for patients through destabilization of pelvic support, and consequently recurrence of POP years after hysterectomy. 15,16 A 2018 systematic review of 53 studies reported that POP surgery with uterine preservation is associated with less blood loss, shorter operating time, and lower odds of graft complications compared to similar surgical routes with hysterectomy, without significant differences in POP outcomes in the years following surgery. 17 However, existing literature is generally limited by small sample sizes (N<200), retrospective data collection, and variable lengths of follow-up. In some instances, comparisons of procedures are not necessarily analogous due to use of different ligaments as suspensory anchors in each surgical group, or comparing native tissue repairs to those augmented with permanent mesh.",

Participants are being recruited from two hospitals, an academic tertiary centre and an academic community hospital, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The five participating surgeons at both sites are Urogynecologists who have completed a fellowship in Pelvic Reconstructive Surgery and are trained to perform both uterine-preserving surgeries and hysterectomies. Our team believes that, in the absence of pelvic pathology such as cervical dysplasia or endometrial hyperplasia, all women seeking surgical correction of POP can chose uterine preservation or hysterectomy. In the context of apical prolapse, there are no patient risk factors (e.g., obesity, age) that we deem to necessitate one procedure over another. Standardized pamphlets developed by the International Urogynecology Association are used to guide collaborative discussion with patients, but decision-making is ultimately patient-driven. In alignment with this philosophy, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is not appropriate for assigning surgical groups; rather, a non-randomized design where women self-select their surgical group is the most patient-centered and ethical approach to studying this topic.",

We estimate that roughly 35% of women will select uterine preservation and 65% will select hysterectomy based on published literature and our clinic experience.

Approximately 75-80% of patients at our study sites participate in research. 34, [40] [41] [42] [43] Our analysis of unpublished data suggests moderate attrition (15%) at 1 year follow-up, which we expect will increase slightly due to the COVID-19 pandemic (20%). Therefore, our target sample size will be 321 participants recruited over a 12-month period with uneven group sizes of n=209 women electing hysterectomy and n=112 women electing uterine preservation. To maximize data generation in the (smaller) uterine preservation group, maintain meaningful precision of results, and reduce the likelihood that our study is underpowered, we plan to continue recruitment until a minimum of 110 women are enrolled in the uterine preservation group and 321 women in the study overall. Since women who choose uterine preservation may differ systematically from women who choose hysterectomy, we will calculate propensity scores defined as the probability of surgical group assignment conditional on measured baseline covariates. We will build a logistic regression model for the propensity to choose uterine preservation (over hysterectomy) using all POP-related, sociodemographic, obstetrical, and personal variables available at baseline. Individuals will then be inverse probability weighted (IPW) using their propensity score for all ensuing analyses; this attempts to mimic the same balance of baseline characteristics achieved with participant randomization, and eliminates individual covariate adjustment and related data sparsity. 44 We will conduct intention-to-treat analysis using generalized linear models to compare each primary and secondary outcomes across study groups. Heterogeneity of surgical approach effect by surgical modality and choice of suspensory ligament will be examined for perioperative outcomes only by adding interaction terms to each model. 45 Between-group differences will be reported using point estimates and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs); results with a 95% CI that do not include the null value (i.e., 1 for ratio estimates and 0 for difference estimates) will be considered statistically significant.",

For any particular trial, it is likely that a particular PRO or PRO domain(s) will be more relevant than others, reflecting the expected effect(s) of the trial intervention(s) in the target patient population. These relevant PRO(s) and/or domain(s) may additionally constitute the important or key secondary PROs (identified a priori and specified as such in the trial protocol and statistical analysis plan) and will be the focus of hypothesis testing. In a regulatory environment, these outcomes may support a labeling claim. Because these outcomes are linked with hypotheses (CONSORT PRO Extension 2b), 17 they may be subject to P-value adjustment (or \"\u03b1 spending\"). Patient-reported outcomes not only may provide evidence of efficacy/effectiveness but also may be intended to capture and provide evidence of safety and tolerability (eg, PRO-CTCAE). 18 Concept: \"The specific measurement goal (ie, the thing that is to be measured by a PRO instrument). In clinical trials, a PRO instrument can be used to measure the effect of a medical intervention on one or more concepts. PRO concepts represent aspects of how patients function or feel related to a health condition or its treatment.\" 4 Domain: \"A subconcept represented by a score of an instrument that measures a larger concept comprised of multiple domains. For example, psychological function is the larger concept containing the domains subdivided into items describing emotional function and cognitive function.\" 4 Instrument: \"A means to capture data (eg, a questionnaire) plus all the information and documentation that supports its use. Generally, that includes clearly defined methods and instructions for administration or responding, a standard format for data collection, and well-documented methods for scoring, analysis, and interpretation of results in the target patient population.\" 4 Item: \"an individual question, statement, or task (and its standardized response options) that is evaluated by the patient to address a particular concept\" 4 Time window: a predefined time frame before and after the protocol-specified PRO assessment time point whereby the result would still be deemed to be clinically relevant 19 seek consensus on the content of the SPIRIT-PRO Extension.

Common reasons for avoidable missing PRO data are administrative errors, lack of explanation of the importance of PRO data, and overly burdensome questionnaires. Addressing these in the protocol should help minimize avoidable missing data. A recent systematic review provides a range of design, implementation, and reporting strategies to help minimize and address missing PRO data. 22 Examples of protocol content include ensuring that PRO end points and hypotheses are clearly defined and scientifically compelling, providing a rationale for PRO assessment, clearly specifying the PRO assessment time points, defining acceptable PRO assessment time windows, aligning PRO assessment time points to clinic visits (if clinically informative), minimizing patient burden, and specifying the importance of complete PRO data. 22 SPIRIT-18b(ii)-PRO Elaboration: Describe the process of PRO assessment for participants who discontinue or deviate from the assigned intervention protocol.

            "text": "The SPIRIT-PRO Extension provides international consensusbased guidance on PRO-specific information that should be included in clinical trial protocols. It comprises 16 items: 5 elaborations to existing SPIRIT 2013 items in the context of PROs and 11 new extensions for use alongside the existing SPIRIT 2013 guidance. 1, 2 It is important to note that these are minimum requirements and that there may be value in including additional items in the protocols, in supplementary information, or in both, as outlined in Supplement 3. Although this guidance has been developed for trials for which PROs are a primary or key secondary outcome, research groups that create protocols are encouraged to consider use of this guidance in all trials or clinical research studies in which PROs are collected, including if PROs are exploratory end points. The guidance does not aim to be prescriptive regarding how information should be included, as this may vary depending on the research setting and local requirements. Further details of empirical evidence underpinning the SPIRIT-PRO items and examples for implementation will be provided in a future publication on the PROlearn 35 and SPIRIT Initiative 20 websites and will be facilitated through further development of the SPIRIT 2013 implementation tool SEPTRE 20 (SPIRIT Electronic Protocol Tool and Resource) and through dissemination via international partners (eAppendix in Supplement 1). Inclusion of PRO-specific protocol content will facilitate appraisal of the PRO elements by funders, reviewers, research ethics committees, and patient partners. The SPIRIT-PRO Extension is intended to encourage and facilitate careful planning of PRO components of trials and thereby improve PRO trial design. Consequently, this is expected to help staff and patients understand the rationale for PRO assessment, improve PRO data completeness and quality, facilitate highquality analysis and reporting, and ultimately improve the quality of the global PRO evidence base.",

As understanding of the pathophysiology of POP has improved, clinicians have acknowledged that the uterus may act as a \"keystone\" of support in the pelvis; removal may thus have unintended consequences for patients through destabilization of pelvic support, and consequently recurrence of POP years after hysterectomy. 15, 16 A 2018 systematic review of 53 studies reported that POP surgery with uterine preservation is associated with less blood loss, shorter operating time, and lower odds of graft complications compared to similar surgical routes with hysterectomy, without significant differences in POP outcomes in the years following surgery. 17 However, existing literature is generally limited by small sample sizes (N<200), retrospective data collection, and variable lengths of follow-up. In some instances, comparisons of procedures are not necessarily analogous due to use of different ligaments as suspensory anchors in each surgical group, or comparing native tissue repairs to those augmented with permanent mesh.",

Our team's approach to care is that, in the absence of pelvic pathology such as cervical or endometrial hyperplasia, all women seeking surgical correction of POP are supported to make an individualized decision between uterine preservation or hysterectomybased procedures, with no preference implied by the surgeon. In the context of apical prolapse, there are no patient risk factors (e.g., obesity, age) that we deem to necessitate one procedure over another.

We will build a logistic regression model for the propensity to choose uterine preservation (over hysterectomy) using all gynecologic (i.e., POP and other gynecologic concerns documented before surgery), sociodemographic, obstetrical, and personal variables available at baseline. Individuals will then be inverse probability weighted (IPW) using their propensity score for all ensuing analyses; this attempts to mimic the same balance of baseline characteristics achieved with participant randomization, and eliminates individual covariate adjustment and related data sparsity. 48 Compared to traditional regression adjustment, application of propensity scores, particularly those developed using high-dimensional data, has been shown to better reduce residual confounding and produce results from observational data that more closely resemble results from RCTs.

Due to inability to link questionnaire data to electronic medical records in real time, PROM data are not reviewed routinely as part of integrated clinical care; however, this data can be made available to assist in patient care upon request from the participant or supervising physician. A protocol has been established for managing unexpected findings during non-routine clinical exams (e.g., diagnosis of a medical condition related to pelvic floor or reproductive organs) or patient complaints of symptoms during study contacts, whereby a member of the research team will liaise with clinic staff to arrange appropriate follow-up care with a physician",

There is an imminent need for high quality evidence on a broad range of short-and longterm outcomes of uterine preservation versus hysterectomy in POP surgery. We plan to disseminate our results to health providers, researchers, and patients to inform them about the risks, benefits, and prognosis of each approach. Results will be presented at research rounds and conferences and published in peer-reviewed articles, with a focus on forums and journals in women's health and gynecology.

King, PhD; and the SPIRIT-PRO Group IMPORTANCE Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data from clinical trials can provide valuable evidence to inform shared decision making, labeling claims, clinical guidelines, and health policy; however, the PRO content of clinical trial protocols is often suboptimal. The SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement was published in 2013 and aims to improve the completeness of trial protocols by providing evidence-based recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed, but it does not provide PRO-specific guidance. OBJECTIVE To develop international, consensus-based, PRO-specific protocol guidance (the SPIRIT-PRO Extension). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The SPIRIT-PRO Extension was developed following the Enhancing Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network's methodological framework for guideline development. This included (1) a systematic review of existing PRO-specific protocol guidance to generate a list of potential PRO-specific protocol items (published in 2014); (2) refinements to the list and removal of duplicate items by the International Society for Quality of Life Research (ISOQOL) Protocol Checklist Taskforce; (3) an international stakeholder survey of clinical trial research personnel, PRO methodologists, health economists, psychometricians, patient advocates, funders, industry representatives, journal editors, policy makers, ethicists, and researchers responsible for evidence synthesis (distributed by 38 international partner organizations in October 2016); (4) an international Delphi exercise (n = 137 invited; October 2016 to February 2017); and (5) consensus meeting (n = 30 invited; May 2017). Prior to voting, consensus meeting participants were informed of the results of the Delphi exercise and given data from structured reviews evaluating the PRO protocol content of 3 defined samples of trial protocols.",

Almost 20% of women will elect surgical correction of this condition by age 85. Removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) with concomitant vaginal vault suspension is a longstanding practice in POP surgery to address apical (uterine) prolapse. Yet, contemporary evidence on the merits of this approach relative to preservation of the uterus through suspension is needed to better inform surgical decision-making by patients and their healthcare providers. The objective of this study is to evaluate POP-specific health outcomes and service utilization of women electing uterine suspension compared to those electing hysterectomy and vaginal vault suspension for POP surgery up to 1-year post-surgery.",

The latter is particularly problematic in the context of gynecology, where only 1 in 3 women have no preference on whether or not to keep their uterus in treating POP.22,23 Moreover, the notion of removing women's autonomy in decisions regarding their reproductive organs too closely resembles the paternalistic backdrop of reproductive healthcare and research that our field has been working to dismantle, and this point should not be overlooked in the quest of internal validity. To this end, our group felt that a non-randomized design where women selfselect their surgical group is the most pragmatic, patient-centered, and ethical approach to studying this topic.Eligibility CriteriaPatients are eligible if they:a) have diagnosed POP of stage \u22652 using the globally recognized Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification System (POP-Q); b) elect surgical management of POP; c) demonstrate presence of apical prolapse on clinical exam deemed to require either a hysterectomy and concomitant vaginal vault suspension or uterine suspension to properly address their POP during surgical correction; d) have no prior hysterectomy; e) desire no further pregnancy; f) can communicate in English; and g) are \u226518 years in age.
