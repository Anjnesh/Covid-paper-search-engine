This 33 emphasizes the need for therapeutic molecules with distinct and novel neutralization 34 mechanisms. Here we isolated a nanobody that interacts simultaneously with two RBDs from 35 different spike trimers of SARS-CoV-2, rapidly inducing the formation of spike trimer-dimers 36 leading to the loss of their ability to attach to the host cell receptor, ACE2. We show that this 37 nanobody potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, including the B.1.351 variant, and cross-neutralizes 38 SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the nanobody against 39 SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.351 variant in a human ACE2 transgenic mouse model. This naturally 40 elicited bispecific monomeric nanobody establishes a novel strategy for potent inactivation of 41 viral antigens and represents a promising antiviral against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54",

Despite rapid 56 progress in vaccine development, some emerging virus variants appear to be less effectively 57 neutralized by antibodies elicited by the first-generation vaccines 1 and the emergence of further 58 variants is expected. To prepare for different scenarios and to have emergency alternatives at 59 hand, novel ways to inhibit and neutralize the virus and variants of concern are needed. As 60 therapeutic agents in the early phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, camelid-derived single-domain 61 antibody fragments are promising candidates. These so-called 'nanobodies' not only bind their 62 antigen with very high specificity and affinity, but they can also be easily produced to large 63 quantities in E. coli 2 and show favorable biochemical characteristics, including good thermal 64 stability. Importantly, they can easily be combined to form homo-and heterodimers or other 65 multimers to increase potency and target multiple epitopes simultaneously 3-5 . This strategy 66 allows the neutralization of multiple known or unknown virus variants and reduces the risk for 67 viral escape 5 .",

            "text": "The attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell receptor ACE2 and subsequent 69 membrane fusion is mediated by the viral spike (S) protein 6 . In the prefusion conformation, the 70 spike is a large homotrimer. Each S monomer consists of two subunits: S1 and S2. The S1 71 subunit contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) and S2 contains the fusion peptide, as well 72 as the transmembrane domain. The RBD is responsible for the initial attachment to ACE2 and is 73 found in two distinct conformational states: The receptor-accessible 'up' conformation and the 74 receptor inaccessible 'down' conformation 6,7 . Receptor binding induces the rather unstable 3-up 75 state, which leads to shedding of S1 and refolding of S2 thereby presenting the fusion peptide to 76 the opposing membrane 6,8,9 . SARS-CoV-2 is easily neutralized by high-affinity binding 77 4 antibodies and other spike-targeting molecules, including nanobodies 10-13 . Many of them bind to, 78 or close to, the receptor binding motif of the RBD and neutralize by directly hindering virus 79 attachment 14,15 . Other mechanisms include locking the RBDs in the down conformation or 80 preventing productive fusion 5,16 . Still, the emergence of new virus variants that evade antibody-81 mediated neutralization mandates the identification of molecules with a more diverse set of 82 binding epitopes and neutralization mechanisms allowing for neutralization of a variety of virus 83 variants. Here, we generated a nanobody that has two non-overlapping interaction sites on the 84 SARS-CoV-2 RBD, each targeting a different epitope, which induces the formation of dimers of 85 spike trimers and rescues mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The Fu2-Fc fusion only slightly increased the neutralization potency of this 101 5 nanobody to 61 ng/ml (0.75 nM), and a chemical homo-dimerization to an IC50 of 26 ng/ml (0.8 102 nM). Thus, the observed enhancement in potency is attributable to dimerization, rather than the 103 Fc-domain itself. Interestingly, the Fu2-Ty1 heterodimer was extremely potent, with an IC50 of 4 104 ng/ml (140 pM) which is approximately 6-fold lower than that of the Fu2 homodimer. Fu2 105 directly prevented spike binding to ACE2 as confirmed by flow cytometry of HEK293T-hACE2 106 cells stained with recombinant, fluorescently labelled spike (+/-Fu2) (Fig. 1C). Analysis of 107 binding kinetics by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) revealed that Fu2 bound the RBD with 108 sub-nanomolar affinity (Fig. 1D). A 1:1 binding model fit the sensorgrams well at the used 109 concentration range, indicating a single dominant interaction. Analysis of next-generation 110 sequencing data for other members of the Fu2 lineage yielded several Fu2-variants with similar 111 properties (Figs. S1A-E).",

In 117 contrast, the addition of Fu2 resulted in a substantial shift of the peak, suggesting the formation 118 of a larger complex, likely a dimer of the spike trimer. Next, we combined the spike with the 119 Fu2-Ty1 heterodimer.

To this end, we performed fluorescence 125 6 correlation spectroscopy and measured apparent brightness of each diffusing particle. The 126 majority of single diffusing particles preincubated with Fu2 showed a 2.5-fold increase in 127 brightness compared to PSV-GFP alone or preincubated with Ty1, suggesting that Fu2 leads to 128 aggregation of the PSV-GFP particles. 129 130 Structural basis for the induction of spike trimer dimers by Fu2. 131 To better understand neutralization and the aggregation of spike by Fu2, we used electron 132 cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of the Fu2-spike complex. The structure 133 revealed a remarkable head-to-head dimerization of the trimeric spike, bound by six molecules of 134 Fu2 (Fig. 2). This distinct structural state appeared as prominent 2D classes in our analyses (Fig. 135 2A). Binding of Fu2 to the RBD is unique as it can simultaneously interact with two different 136 RBDs from different spike trimers in the up conformation (Figs. 2B and 2C). To our knowledge, 137 Fu2 is the only nanobody or spike-binding molecule developed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike 138 to have this property. Our high resolution (2.9\u00c5; 0.143 FSC) localized reconstruction of the 139 RBD-Fu2-RBD-Fu2 interface helped us elucidate the molecular details of this interaction. Each 140 RBD in the complex provides two binding interfaces for two Fu2 molecules, which we call 141 'interface-major' and 'interface-minor' according to surface area covered (Figs. 2D, S2A and 142 S2B). The interface-major and interface-minor have a buried surface area of ~740 \u00c5 2 and 143 ~495 \u00c5 2 , respectively. Parts of the Fu2 framework regions drive the dimerization by shape-144 complementarity and coupled solvent exclusion in the two interfaces. In addition, the interface-145 major consists of 15 hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge between Fu2 D117 and RBD K378, 146 while the interface-minor comprises five hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, a region around the Fu2 147 b-turn A40-K43 plays a key role in dimerization through interactions with two proximal RBDs 148 (Figs. S2C and S2D). Specifically, one of the two proximal RBDs' T500-Y505 region packs 149 7 against the Fu2 A40-K43 b-turn and the RBD Y505 is in addition bound by Fu2 Q39. 150",

SWISS-MODEL: Homology modelling of protein structures and Fu2 variants identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS) display similar 731 neutralization potential and binding kinetics. (A) Average difference of Fu2 variants is shown 732 as a tree diagram. (B) Fu2 and seven Fu2-variants were expressed in E. coli, purified, and 733 analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. (C) A dilution series of Fu2 and its variants 734 were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus (PSV) for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C before 735 infecting HEK293T-hACE2 cells. Neutralization (in %) compared to the untreated PSV is 736 shown. (D) Binding kinetics of Fu2 and variants to the RBD were measured by surface plasmon 737 resonance (SPR). Site-specifically biotinylated RBD was immobilized on streptavidin sensor 738 chips, and kinetics for a dilution series of the indicated monomeric nanobodies were measured. 739 Sensorgrams are color-coded based on concentration. The fit is based on the 1:1 Langmuir model 740 and is shown in dark grey solid lines. (E) Kinetic parameters of Fu2 and Fu2 variants binding to 741 the RBD.",
