The study aimed to understand the lived experiences of migrant workers during the early months of the pandemic using a qualitative phenomenological approach. Thirteen men working as migrant workers in Mumbai, India were interviewed telephonically and the data obtained was analysed using thematic analysis. Migrant workers highlighted the challenges they experienced in getting back home, fears of dying alone away from home, the stress of unemployment and poverty and its impact on them and their families. They expressed feelings of guilt, shame, and helplessness about not knowing what will happen in the future. Using an intersectional lens the study highlights how the identity of being a migrant worker further marginalised these individuals, thereby impacting their well-being and presents implications for mental health policy and practice.",

The pandemic has not just been a public health crisis; it has led to a new psychosocial experience wherein terms like 'lockdown' and 'social distancing' have become a part of daily discourse. In fact, never has an event in the recent past had such an overwhelming impact that an entire period of time is referred to by the name of the crisis itself. The phrase \"Corona times\" or \"Covid times\" is used to depict the entirety of the psychological and social disruptions and transformations that have occurred since the pandemic struck most countries across the world. The experience of the pandemic, however, has been far from homogeneous. While it is true that Covid-19 has had a devastating impact on the lives and livelihoods of people, individuals' experiences have been determined by their social location and their positions of privilege. During these times, those who are socio-economically advantaged have had access to essential services, quality health and mental health care, and insurance facilities. Simultaneously, traditionally disadvantaged groups have faced unique risks and consequences that have pushed them even further away from the mainstream.",

Crenshaw (as cited in Steinmetz, 2020, para 3) defined intersectionality as \"a lens, a prism, for seeing the way in which various forms of inequality often operate together and exacerbate each other...and the experience (of inequality) is not just the sum of its parts. Intersectionality as an idea originally focused on the intersection between race and gender, but has significantly expanded to focusing on \"simultaneous oppressions\" that individuals and groups experience by virtue of many other social identities such as gender, caste, class, race, geography, etc. (Carastathis, 2014, p.307) . For instance, Lewis (2020) has described the coronavirus pandemic as a disaster for feminism, especially because of the unequal burden that women have suffered due to lockdown. Bowleg (2020) coined the phrase \"We're Not All in This Together\" in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and highlighted that the 'collective we' in our imagination is not so uniform and homogeneous; and that structural inequalities demand special attention be given to needs of those who are invisibilised in mainstream public discourse.",

Maharashtra accounts for one of the largest share of migrants who have moved to the state for better employment opportunities with about 60 lakh migrants as per Census 2011 (Iyer, 2020) . Migrant workers form an essential part of the backbone of metropolitan cities helping make up for labour shortfalls at minimum wages. Yet at another level they truly exist at the periphery in shanties and slums with bare minimum facilities. Due to the mobile nature of their existence (most are registered as voters in their hometowns), they often form a non-voting group in their destination cities-and thus are often rendered politically insignificant despite their large numbers (Bijoor, 2020) . \"They\" are invisible, yet their mere presence makes \"us\" more visible, by allowing for well-functioning cities.",

However from March 2020 onwards, the number of cases started rising steadily and fears of community transmission (stage in the spread of an infection when it becomes impossible to know the source of infection in a given community) grew, resulting in a 3 week long strict lockdown being announced in March 2020 (Vara, 2020) , which was further extended to another few months. During the lockdown, to prevent the further spread of the infection and shore up medical facilities, the government banned all non-essential movement and activities across the entire country.",

In the absence of any public transportation available till May 2020, many started walking back home, hundreds of kilometers away from their destination cities. Others paid exorbitant amounts to arrange for private transport, which further put stress on their already precarious circumstances. Government data suggest that about 6700000 migrants travelled home from their cities of work during the lockdown period, precipitating an unprecedented psychosocial and structural crisis (Mathew, 2020) . Chander et al. (2020) focused on the experiences of migrant workers living in shelter camps in Bangalore, India during the pandemic. They found that some of the key concerns faced by the migrant workers included uncertainty about the future, fear of being abandoned by their employers, substance use issues and concerns about other health issues. Similarly, Choudhari (2020) highlighted the fact that migrant workers are uniquely vulnerable due to their socio-economic status, poor living conditions and chronic malnutrition, absence of family support, absence of effective laws for the unorganised sector and barriers in accessing psychiatric help. Choudhari (2020) also emphasized these vulnerabilities as a breeding ground for peritraumatic psychological distress for internal migrant workers.",

The phenomenological paradigm was used to guide this research, with the aim to privilege the voices of the participants and understand their unique experiences related to Covid-19 within their intersectional realities. Qualitative phenomenological research focuses on the 'what' and 'how' of the experience (Moustakas, 1994) . Carel et al. (2020) have highlighted the importance of phenomenological work in the context of the pandemic due to the disruptions in interpersonal and social experiences caused due to various preventive measures. Some of these changes have brought people together while others have magnified existing disparities. In exploring the lived experiences of a marginalized and vulnerable group, this study brings forth the realities of the pandemic for migrant workers in India.",

An interview guide was developed to explore the following domains -understanding about the pandemic, practices followed, meaning making, the psychological, social and economic impact of Covid-19. Some of the questions asked were: Why do you think the pandemic happened? What kind of precautions are you taking? How has the pandemic impacted your work?

It creates an opportunity for researchers to reflect on the limits and possibilities of understanding an experience and finally helps them understand their own place in the research process. In our research, since most participants did not have any savings to rely on, they often asked the interviewers if they knew of any way that the government could provide them financial relief and support. This was a challenging moment for the research team-while we could offer contacts for relief agencies and non-governmental organisations, we were not in a position to offer immediate financial aid. The process of immersing ourselves in the interview data also generated a lot of questions. What could we offer to this group besides a space to share and voice their concerns? How do we manage our own distress and what space does it occupy in the research process? Is there a them vs. us? How do we reimagine a language of inclusion? These questions need to be reflected on and also highlight the nature of power exerted within the research process and its impact on the 'researcher' as well as the 'researched'. Certain practices were considered to ensure that we were sensitive and responsive to our participants and our team. We were mindful of the language that we used and made an honest effort to avoid objectifying the experiences of migrant workers. For instance, in the use of the pronoun they/them, we retained an awareness that it could very well be me or us facing similar dilemmas had we been in the position that our participants were in. We recognize and acknowledge the fact that individual circumstances, social location and context have a very important role to play in the psychological experience of Covid-19.",

Even though consent for participation in the study was taken, participants were not always available for detailed conversation, or were hesitant to speak on the phone for a long duration, as they were dealing with many constraints and challenges, including financial insecurity and distress. At these times, it was not considered appropriate to probe further or shift focus to explore other aspects of their experiences. We believe that especially while working with people in traumatic crises it is absolutely essential to respect their realities and the limits placed by those on the research process. An ethical choice was made to prioritise participant comfort and readiness over the 'thickness of data'. Brzuzy et al. (1997) have also highlighted this dilemma as an ethical 'tension' (p.79), between the need to get in-depth information and the possibility of retraumatization.",

Their decision to go back was motivated by different pressures-fear of getting Covid-19 and having no one around, no money or social protection to sustain themselves in one of the most expensive cities of India and wanting to be with family in the midst of a pandemic. Many of them had to borrow money to arrange for travel back home (since inter-state public and private transport was suspended). Amal, a 32-year-old tailor spoke of his experience and said, \"We rented a bus to come home. For the fare, our family had to deposit their valuables as security in return for money and send that to us with which we paid for our journey.\" Going back to their villages was an ordeal for most participants, especially the struggle to find affordable transportation. And not everyone made it back home. Rehman said \"The day we were returning from Bombay\u2026 maybe 50 of them died. Who died there? Did rich people die? It was the poor people that died.\" Another participant, Imran, a 20-year-old mason, at the time of the research interviews, had still not been able to get back home. He spoke of his experience and shared that \"Since I am not at home, I do not like anything at all\u2026only thinking when I will be back at home and stay with my parents\u2026this is all I am thinking about\u2026please make some arrangement, otherwise I will die.\" The research team provided him with contacts of relief organisations, but the sheer desperation and panic at not being able to get back home brought about a lot of tension and worry for him. He further shared that \"I feel morose that my friends are at home now\u2026while I am stuck in a foreign land (\"bideshe pore achi\").",

But there was a lot of fear. How will people live without fear in such a situation? Children were inside the house because of fear, they did not go out at all. They didn't play at all. My wife also did not leave the house. Everyone just remained in their house with doors closed, so even talking did not happen the way it did earlier. (Nilesh) One of the participants expressed that he chose to come back from Mumbai because he feared that if he died in the city because of the virus his family would not get to see him one last time. Death was not a far-fetched idea anymore-it was right around the corner and all he wanted was his family to be around so that he would be \"seen and mourned\". Salim shared that I felt scared. I worried what if I don't get the chance to go back home, if I contract the disease by any chance and if I die over here, they won't send the body home, they will bury me here. Maybe my parents will receive a message or maybe a letter. These kinds of thoughts used to come to my mind, I couldn't sleep at night. (Salim) Participants said that they felt much safer in their villages where they said no cases had been reported at the time when they were interviewed. But they mentioned that when they came back to the village, initially they had fears about quarantine and isolation in case they tested positive. Alam, a 28year-old tailor, shared \"That is something that the police would tell us. That you cannot go near anyone. You cannot get out of the house. They would seal the area of the village. We would not be able to get out.\"",

For the participants of our study, the journey from Mumbai to their homes was not an easy one. They had to deal with many logistical and financial difficulties from arranging transport to dealing with news of other people dying on the way home. Participants highlighted several psychosocial difficulties that they were facing due to the pandemic. From being the sole earners supporting entire families back home they became jobless overnight, with little clarity or direction on what would come next. Simultaneously, migrant workers had to deal with many uncertainties that often extended beyond their immediate concerns. They were not just worried about their own survival but also about their families and children, especially childrens' education. A recent report by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization [UNESCO] , United Nations Children's Fund [UNICEF] and World Bank has estimated that nearly 1.5 billion children have been affected by school closures globally, which is likely to lead to a learning loss especially for children belonging to low-income countries (UNESCO, UNICEF, & World Bank, 2020) . Thus, concerns about employment, money, poverty, hunger and childrens' education became huge psychosocial stressors that they had to negotiate on a daily basis.",

Participants reported that they were afraid of dying alone in the city without their families around so they decided to go back home. At the same time the stress of being back home without any way of financially supporting themselves and their families generated great amounts of uncertainty and helplessness in the participants. They experienced feelings of guilt and frustration at not being able to find a job and worried constantly about the future. Participants reported experiencing worries about the future, helplessness and a fear that the world and 'normal life' was about to change indefinitely. Their sense of personal agency and certainty was taken away almost overnight which generated distress in them. Kumar et al. (2020) studied the psychological impact of Covid-19 with 98 migrant workers in India and found that nearly 75% of the migrants screened positive for depression and nearly half of the sample screened positive for both depression and anxiety. They attributed the high levels of depression in the migrant groups to financial insecurity, worries about their own health as well of loved ones and concerns around being alone and not being able to support their families. The distress experienced by migrant workers has been understood through multiple lenses-diagnostically as depression and anxiety, psychosocially as an interface of contextual factors and individual subjectivities, and within larger structures of governance, poverty, class, socio-economic status and so on. Yet at the same time, there needs to be a keen awareness that this experience cannot be located within the individual alone. Further, the distress and challenges experienced by participants also had an adverse impact on their families and their relationships with significant others. Lamba (2020) has argued that the pandemic may have an intergenerational impact as individuals and families experience multiple losses that are often ambiguous and are left to grapple with difficult and often unanswerable questions about what comes next.",

            "text": "Thus the understanding of the multi-layered nature of the distress experienced by migrant workers calls for a trauma informed lens towards mental health care. Clervil et al. (2013) have argued for trauma informed care for displaced populations and highlighted the sense of helplessness and lack of control that displaced groups experience in the aftermath of a traumatic event (in this case the pandemic and the lockdown). Hopper et al. (2010) have defined trauma-informed care as \"a strengths based framework that is grounded in an understanding of and responsiveness to the impact of trauma, that emphasizes physical, psychological, and emotional safety for both providers and survivors, and that creates opportunities for survivors to rebuild a sense of control and empowerment\" (p.82). Some of the important principles of trauma informed care include promoting safety, supporting choice, autonomy and control, sharing governance and power, integrative and culturally sensitive care and ultimately instilling hope about recovery (Hopper et al., 2010) . These need to be the guiding light of mental health interventions and policy formulation. Further, Endale et al. (2020) have highlighted that support services to displaced groups during the pandemic need to provide psychological first aid, which includes providing information and reassurance about the pandemic as well as about resources to meet their immediate needs, proactive outreach to mitigate the impact of isolation, extensive case management to provide different kinds of support services and telemedicine and online communication for individual and family mental health. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has called for social protection for migrant workers to help them deal with the social, emotional and psychological trauma that they have gone through especially during lockdown (Press Trust of India, 2020). We must also question how mental health work needs to be conceptualised and implemented with groups that are facing such acute psychosocial distress-wherein individual realities are deeply embedded in intersectional realities. Is it possible for mental health workers to focus on healing and recovery while also acknowledging and integrating the systemic influences and if so what would be the nature of that work. Psychosocial support during crises and disasters needs to look at liaising with other relief organisations and agencies providing care and relief. Mental health work in this context then, needs to be embedded with developmental and relief programmes and cannot simply exist as an isolated intervention. For instance, provision of basic relief materials can be combined with psychological first-aid and at each step we must recognise the need for responsive, empathic and socially just interventions and support. Further, it is equally important to give due attention to training of professionals and frontline workers. In resource-stressed countries like India, mental health work with migrant workers needs frontline workers and staff who receive adequate training and supervision in trauma informed care, environments which are safe and respect the privacy and confidentiality of individuals, and culturally sensitive assessment and goal planning (Clervil et al., 2013) .",

For instance, participants highlighted how the disturbance in gender roles because of unemployment impacted their relationships. In this context some of the questions that need to be looked at include what role does gender play in the experience of the lockdown, especially since most migrant workers were the sole male breadwinners of their families? How does unemployment and masculinity interface in the context of the pandemic? Does the pressure of being 'the man of the house' add pressures on men? Are certain religious and cultural groups further marginalised?",

This was also highlighted by several participants in the study who compared themselves to 'rich people' and shared that they faced immense difficulties because they were poor. The only thing that they were focused on presently was survival. Other researchers have also highlighted the need for decisive and proactive governmental intervention. Espinel et al. (2020) explored the experiences of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia during Covid-19 and emphasized that migrants need to be prioritised in the public health care system, especially because of their vulnerability to a wide range of mental health concerns due to the hardships that they face in the process of migration.",

            "text": "Finally, migrants form such a critical part of the economy of flourishing cities-yet remain unseen and unheard in the midst of one of the biggest crises that the world has seen. Mumbai, being the commercial capital of the country has often been considered as \"karmabhoomi\". 1 The city acts as a symbol of opportunity, hope and possibilities for thousands of people who move here every year in search of a better life. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, migrant workers became 'the nowhere people'. Their lives were transformed almost overnight and they found themselves displaced; belonging to 'nowhere' geographically, as their places of work shut down indefinitely and going back home became an overwhelming challenge with lockdown restrictions. This dislocation was not just geographical, they were forced to abandon their hopes and dreams of a better life which left them feeling lost and helpless. Their socio-economic vulnerability along with structural inequalities meant that they don't really belong anywhere-not to the states where they migrated to nor to the states where their families reside. And so perhaps migrants form a separate group altogether-'the nowhere people' who have been left to fend for themselves in a turbulent time. Bansal (2020) in her paper on Covid-19 and its implications for a \"post-coronial psychology\" has argued that migrants were either seen as objects of pity or as carriers of infection to the rural hinterland in mainstream discourse-and that there was an urgent need to view them with dignity and respect, and perhaps more importantly not just as \"them\" but as \"us\". Bansal (2020) calls for a critical-cultural reflection of local and global frameworks and an imagination of the \"new normal\" which is cognisant of the structural inequities of society and is equally responsive to it. Thus our understanding of migrant workers as a group also needs deep reflection and enquiry.",

The research used an intersectional frame to understand how different social identities of migrant status, gender and class coalesce together to generate unique forms of marginalization. It calls for future policy and practice work to acknowledge and integrate the lived experiences of those who remain on the edges, invisible yet critical backbones of a well-functioning and harmonious society. Finally, it emphasises that the pandemic is just a mirror being held up to all of us-and the 'reflections' and 'lessons' need to be carried forward, remembered, documented and transformed into action that is meaningful to the lives of people.",
