            "text": "On 11 March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) was declared a global pandemic affecting countries worldwide, including Canada. 1 As of 1 March 2021, Canada has had 870 033 COVID-19 cases and 22 017 deaths, of which 301 839 cases and 6968 deaths have been in the province of Ontario. 2 In March 2020, the Ontario government directed all hospitals and regulated healthcare professionals to ramp down elective and non-emergent clinical services in order to limit the transmission of COVID-19 and preserve health system capacity to treat COVID-19 cases and other critical illnesses. 3, 4 Following this, Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario), a provincial agency that oversees healthcare delivery across the province, released guidance for the provision of cancer services during the pandemic. 5, 6 Consistent with provincial guidance 5,6 , on 23 March 2020, it was recommended that all routine cancer screening services be paused. Invitation, recall and reminder correspondence to eligible screening participants, a key element of Ontario's organised cancer screening programmes, was suspended. Following a decrease in COVID-19 transmission in Ontario, at the end of May 2020, the gradual resumption of deferred services was permitted. 7 In 2020, it was estimated that 553 individuals in Ontario would be diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer and 185 would die from the disease. 8 Most invasive cervical cancer is preventable with human papillomavirus (HPV) immunisation, regular screening, and appropriate and timely followup of abnormal screening results. 9 Organised cervical screening programmes, including the Ontario Cervical Screening Program (OCSP), seek to detect and treat cervical cancer precursors to prevent the progression to invasive cervical cancer. 10 The OCSP currently recommends individuals aged 21-69 years with a cervix be screened with cervical cytology every 3 years. 11 To support the prioritisation of cases in colposcopy (a diagnostic procedure following abnormal cervical screening results 12 ) during the pandemic, some screeningrelated colposcopy services were recommended to continue (i.e. follow-up of high-grade screening results), whereas others were recommended to be reduced and deferred (i.e. follow-up of low-grade screening results). 5, 6 The objective of this study was to describe the impact of the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of cervical screening, colposcopy and treatment services in Ontario.",

The province of Ontario has a publicly funded single-payer healthcare system. Throughout the province, 14 regional cancer programmes are involved in providing cancer prevention, screening, diagnostic, treatment and other support services. The OCSP, a populationbased organised cervical screening programme, currently recommends individuals aged 21-69 years with a cervix be screened with cervical cytology every 3 years. 11 Approximately 1 million people undergo 1.1 million cervical cytology tests annually in Ontario. Following a high-grade cytology result, individuals are recommended to receive colposcopy, whereas those with low-grade results are recommended to repeat cytology in 6 months. 11 Colposcopy allows a clinician to identify a cervical lesion, confirm a diagnosis by biopsy and advise either treatment for cervical cancer precursors or conservative management in the absence of cancer precursors. 12 All individuals aged 21-69 years with a cervix who received cervical screening cytology, colposcopy or treatment between January 2019 and August 2020 were included in the study. Individuals younger than 21 years, or 70 years and older were excluded.",

In the absence of a dedicated colposcopy database, the OHIP database was used to identify colposcopy visits and cervical treatment procedures including the date of service. Procedures used for the treatment of cervical dysplasia included local electrosurgical excision procedure, cone biopsy, cryoconisation, electroconisation, CO 2 laser therapy, electrocautery and cryotherapy. The Registered Persons Database contains information on Ontarians eligible for OHIP 15 and was used to capture the demographic information (i.e. age and postal code) of participants.

As the pandemic continues, it is expected that these services may continue to be reduced for some time for several reasons. First, the rigorous infection prevention and control measures that remain in place reduce the volume of interactions that colposcopists and primary care providers (PCPs) are able to engage in. Secondly, some PCPs have not resumed in-person visits for preventive care. Finally, as of March 2021, cervical screening correspondence letters inviting people to get screened have remained paused.",

            "text": "Similar COVID-19-related reductions in cervical screening volumes have been observed internationally. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Of particular concern in Ontario, is the approximately 50% fewer highgrade screening cytology results identified in each of the first 6 months of the pandemic as compared with each of the previous 4 months. Additionally, among the 3967 individuals with high-grade cytology identified between November 2019 and August 2020, almost a third (29.2%) had not received colposcopy as of August 2020. Of these, a third (33.2%) have been awaiting follow-up since before the pandemic (i.e. February 2020 or earlier, \u22656 months). In contrast, between 2016 and 2018, 13.5-15.7% of individuals with high-grade cytology in Ontario did not receive colposcopy within 6 months. 21 Timely detection and follow-up of abnormal screening results, and treatment as appropriate, are a crucial element of reducing the risk of progression to invasive cervical cancer. 9,22 A population-based study from Ontario found that 1.1-2.9% of individuals with high-grade cytology had underlying invasive cervical cancer. 23 During the first few months of the pandemic in Ontario, some individuals with high-grade cytology results had their follow-up colposcopy visit delayed, which could have delayed the diagnosis and possible treatment of cervical pre-cancers. The longer these individuals wait, the risk of them being lost to follow-up, and potentially present at a later date with a more advanced cancer that is more difficult to treat and cure, increases.",

To support PCPs and colposcopists, in June 2020, Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) released two tip sheets outlining considerations for resuming cervical screening and colposcopy services including risk-based priority classification frameworks. 25, 26 Recommendations from these tip sheets include that where colposcopy capacity is limited, patients with high-grade cytology should be prioritised for colposcopy, as their immediate risk of high-grade cervical dysplasia is high. 25 In addition, for patients with first-time low-grade cytology results, colposcopy referral is discouraged; instead, PCPs are encouraged to repeat cytology within 12 months, as the risk of high-grade cervical dysplasia is low and cytological changes generally reflect transient HPV infection that will not cause cervical cancer. 25, 26 Finally, PCPs are encouraged to adopt the planned change of initiating cervical screening at age 25 years 26 (rather than 21 years), given the strong evidence that screening prior to that age is highly unlikely to be of benefit. 27 Similar recommendations could be considered by other jurisdictions facing similar capacity constraints.",

While ensuring individual providers understand the importance of appropriate screening and colposcopy referral is imperative, facility-or regional-level strategies for optimising resource use to manage the colposcopy backlog will also be required. For example, facilities and regional cancer programmes could consider implementing centralised referral intake (i.e. coordinated points of entry for receiving referrals) and colposcopy waitlists (i.e. patients are booked for the next available appointment with an appropriate provider in their region). 25 Ongoing monitoring of local data will also be important for recovery planning. 25 To support this, Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) has created a tool that allows for both provincial and local monitoring of screening, colposcopy and treatment volumes, as well as the number of individuals with high-grade cytology awaiting follow-up. 28 Regional cancer programmes have reported that the tool has been used to support local planning, recovery and communication efforts. Other jurisdictions could consider similar tools and strategies to assist with monitoring, recovery and planning efforts.",

Additionally, it is difficult to determine whether a cytology test in CytoBase was done for screening or diagnostic purposes, and therefore a small number of cytology tests included in these analyses may have been performed for diagnostic purposes.
