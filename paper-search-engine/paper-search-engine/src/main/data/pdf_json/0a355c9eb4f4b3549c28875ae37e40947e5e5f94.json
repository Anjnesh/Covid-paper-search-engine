Quantification of blood nitrite and nitrate, two relatively stable metabolites of NO (generally as NOx), has been acknowledged representing NO bioactivity partially. Dysregulation of NOx had been reported in SARS-CoV-2 infected populations, but whether patients recovered from COVID-19 disease present with restored NOx is unknown. In this study, serum NO2and NO3were quantified and analyzed among 109 recovered adults in comparison to a control group of 166 uninfected adults. Nitrite or nitrate levels were not significantly different among mild-, common-, severe-and critical-type patients. However, these recovered patients had dramatically lower NO2and NO2 -/NO3than the uninfected group (p<0.0001), with significantly higher NO3levels (p=0.0023) than the uninfected group. Nitrate and nitrite/nitrate were positively and negatively correlated with patient age, respectively, with age 65 being a turning point among recovered patients. These results indicate that low NO2 -, low NO2 -/NO3and high NO3may be a potential biomarker of long-term poor or irreversible outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. It suggests that NO metabolites might serve as a predictor to track the health status of recovered COVID-19 patients, highlighting the need to elucidate the role of NO after SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

As of August 22, 2021 , the total number of confirmed infected cases of COVID-19 stood at 211 million worldwide, with a death toll of 4.4 million (from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering) [1] . The possibility of developing a severe case of disease and the mortality rate are reported to be influenced substantially by age and the presence of comorbidities, as well as sex [2] [3] [4] . Estimates of the influence of age using data from 16 countries suggest that people aged 65 years and older were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a higher admission rate to intensive care units (ICUs) and a higher fatality rate than younger individuals [5] . Multiple reasons for this age-related susceptibility have been proposed including a link to metabolic, respiratory, or cardiovascular comorbidities [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . For example, COVID-19 patients with existing hypertension have been reported to be more vulnerable to severe disease progression and mortality [7, 12] , with evidence supported by numerous further larger studies and recent meta-analyses of 24 studies from across the globe [13] . Moreover, substantial organ dysfunction among recovered COVID-19 patients has been increasingly reported, which is both unexpected and troubling [14] [15] [16] .",

Besides its role as an important vasodilator, NO also functions as a vital immune mediator, including non-specific antiviral effects. S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), a NO donor, has been reported to improve the host cell survival following infection in one study [18, 19] , and suppress the replication cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) at RNA and cellular levels and interfere with spike protein activity in another study [20] .

Targeting NO is a double-edged sword, depending on where, how and how much of it is produced [33] . The effects described above of NO are evidenced with high concentrations of ~30-200 \uf06dM. In a small study, detection of nitrite (NO2 -) and nitrate (NO3 -) (commonly referred as NOx) using photometric analysis or the Griess assay was shown to be elevated, suggesting that NO levels were increased, in 11 critically ill non-surviving COVID-19 patients compared to 45 survivors [34] . However, conversely, in several reports, decreased basal NO production or bioavailability (normally in the 100-400 nM range) has been suggested to underlie elevated apoptosis of endothelial cells induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, increased inflammation, or excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) [23, 24, 35] . One recent study reported decreased total NO, nitrite and SNO in COVID-19 patients in hospital [36] . Another study in Spain showed that nitric oxide diffusion was reduced in around 40% patients discharged from hospital, via respiratory function tests with a MasterScreen PFT equipment [37] . To date, the levels of NO in blood among patients discharged from hospitals, i.e. \"recovered patients\", remain unknown.",

Therefore, the association between nitrite and nitrate (NOx) and age were analyzed in these two groups (Figure 3, Figure S3 ). In the recovered group, there existed positive correlation between nitrate and age, and negative correlation between the ratio of nitrite/nitrate and age ( Figure   3D -F). Such correlations were not observed in the uninfected group (Figure 3A-C) . Since an age of 65 years or older is considered as a high-risk factor for COVID-19 [5] , we further split each group into 18-64 and 65-83 years old subgroups and performed multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and a simple effect analysis. As for nitrite and nitrite/nitrate, recovered adults in the same-age ranges still had dramatically lower levels than the uninfected peers ( Figure 3G, 3I) , with the opposite trend of nitrate levels ( Figure 3H ). In addition, nitrate and nitrite/nitrate levels were significantly higher and lower in the recovered (65-83) than in the recovered (18-64) subgroup ( Figure 3H-I) , respectively. The results indicate that high NO3and low NO2 -/NO3may serve a promising marker for long-term consequences among aged people infected by SARS-CoV-2.",

In this study, the opposite changes were observed for serum nitrite and nitrate in the recovered group compared to the uninfected group. It suggests that nitrite and nitrate may get produced and function differently in vivo. In one study by Joshi et al. in 2002 , NO was majorly and irreversibly consumed by oxy-hemoglobin to form nitrate under normoxia, instead of being conserved as nitrite or S-nitrosohemoglobin (one type of S-nitrosothiol, SNO) [50] . Less than 1% of homogenously delivered NO from its donor was converted into nitrite or SNO [50] . As reported for recovered COVID-19 patients [51] , they usually encounter shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, which might suggest that their blood hemoglobin needs to work more diligently in order to deliver enough oxygen and therefore consume more NO. This speculation of a compensatory effect of hemoglobin certainly needs experimental confirmation.",

Aging has been linked to detrimental NO production and bioavailability [55] , which seems in accordance with lower NO2 -/NO3and higher NO3in patients 65 years or older in this study. One potential cause for the decreased nitrite levels in recovered group may lie in perturbed gut microbiota of COVID-19 patients [56] . In one study of 100 patients after clearance of SARS-CoV-2, the level of a gut bacterium with immunomodulatory potential, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, was reported to be diminished when compared to a healthy control group. A summary of the above factors that influence NOx serum levels as they relate to COVID-19 disease are presented in Scheme 1. The commensal microbe F. prausnitzii has been shown to affect NO production via J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 12 iNOS induction [57] . Commensal gut bacteria also modulate nitrate reduction to nitrite [58] , and might be depleted in COVID-19 patients. These additive effects may then cause lower NO availability, which triggers more nitrite reduction to NO in order to remedy the loss of NO among patients.",
