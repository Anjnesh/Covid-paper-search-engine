The purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of loneliness on mental health and behavioural outcomes, as well as the moderating and mediating effects of biopsychosocial variables on these relationships. The data were collected during France's first national COVID-19 lockdown and included 556 participants (M age = 30.06 years, range = 18-87) who completed well-known validated measures assessing symptom-levels of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. They also indicated their level of worry about the COVID-19 crisis, and provided sociodemographic and health status data. Responses were submitted to hierarchical linear regression and mediation analyses. In terms of prevalence of loneliness, 18.9% of participants reported severe loneliness. High levels of loneliness were significantly associated with the three mental health and behavioural outcomes. The lonelinessanxiety relationship was moderated by employment and working arrangements. The lonelinessinsomnia relationship was moderated by living conditions, history of medical or psychological problems, and COVID-19-related worry. Further findings supported the indirect effects of COVID-related worry on pathways from loneliness to the three mental health and behavioural health outcomes. The mediation models accounted for 28.9%, 33.7%, and 15.0% of the variance in anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The present evidence-based findings revealed that loneliness and worry were major contributing factors of mental health and behavioural concerns during the COVID-19 lockdown. They could inform treatment recommendations for tackling prolonged-self isolation and loneliness in specific vulnerable groups.",

By January 2021, France had become the third most affected European country in terms of COVID-19 cases and deaths. In response to successive outbreaks, the French Government has imposed strict public health measures, including a total national lockdown during the first outbreak, when universities, and nonessential businesses had to close, and sports, religious and cultural events were cancelled. In addition to public health measures, social distancing has become the main policy in terms of public behaviour. Research has shown that even though public health measures like these are necessary to curb the rapid worldwide spread of the virus, they have affected the psychological wellbeing and mental health of large portions of the world's populations (Brooks et al., 2020) . Meta-analytic findings have revealed high prevalence rates of severe mental health conditions, including posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep problems among COVID-19 survivors, healthcare workers, and the general public Marvaldi et al., 2021) . The unknowns and uncertainties surrounding the timeline of the pandemic are additional sources of overwhelming stress and worry (Paluszek et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021) . Furthermore, the immediate COVID-19-induced stress during the first outbreak was found to predict subsequent development of mental health and behavioural risks (Megalakaki et al., 2021) .",

In adult samples in the United Kingdom, two studies (Bu et al., 2020b; Groarke et al., 2020) found high loneliness levels in young people, people on lower incomes, the economically inactive, and people with mental health conditions. Furthermore, Groarke et al. (2020) reported that living with others or in a rural area, and having more close friends or greater social support were protective factors. Findings for sex-related differences are mixed (Bu et al., 2020b; Groarke et al., 2020; Wickens et al., 2021) . In a German adult sample, Buecker et al. (2020) found that daily loneliness increased more strongly for parents than for people without children. However, these studies did not examine the interactions between loneliness and these group factors in relation to mental health problems. A study conducted in Israel by Grossman et al. (2021) reported that sleep problems are associated with the loneliness-worry interaction, with lonely individuals with higher levels of worry about the pandemic reporting severe sleep problems.",

However, there is still a clear lack of empirical knowledge about the interactions between loneliness and these group factors in relation to mental health problems in the current COVID-19 literature, and closing this lacuna would allow the development of evidence-based health interventions for specific vulnerable groups. Researchers have made some recommendations for tackling prolonged self-isolation and loneliness during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, based on previous studies conducted in a nonepidemic context (Beam & Kim, 2020) . However, it is still unclear just how relevant these recommendations are for vulnerable individuals with mental health concerns induced by the pandemic. In addition, emerging data suggest that loneliness has a differential impact on adverse health outcomes in different age groups, with changes in loneliness during the pandemic accounting for much of the increase in depressive symptoms -but not anxiety -among young adults (Bu et al., 2020b; Lee et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is highly worthwhile using multiple mental health outcome assessments to gain an in-depth view of potential differences in the health consequences of loneliness across different sociodemographic groups during the pandemic.",

See Supplementary Material for Tables (1-4). High loneliness scores were also significantly associated with insomnia, except for models where we entered the multiplicative terms Loneliness * Place of residence and Loneliness * Marital status. In total, we found four significant interactions: one between loneliness and anxiety, and three between loneliness and insomnia. First, working arrangements were found to moderate the relationship between loneliness and anxiety (\u00df = 1.75, SE = 0.57, p < .001). As depicted in Fig. 1 , when we plotted this interaction, we found that while higher levels of loneliness were associated with greater anxiety, this association was stronger among individuals who had lost their job because of the pandemic. Of note, the Loneliness * Working arrangements interaction almost significantly predicting insomnia symptoms, such that feelings of loneliness among individuals who worked from home (\u00df = \u22120.87, SE = 0.50, p = .08), followed by those who still went out to work (\u00df = \u22120.71, SE = 0.38, p = .06), tended to be associated with greater insomnia. Second, living conditions moderated the loneliness -insomnia relationship (\u00df = \u22121.02, SE = 0.37, p < .001). Visual inspection of Fig. 2 showed that participants with higher loneliness scores and who lived without family or other close relatives reported more severe insomnia. Third, the association between loneliness and insomnia varied according to health antecedents (\u00df = \u22120.80, SE = 0.40, p < .01). As can be seen in Fig. 3 , individuals with preexisting health problems who experienced greater feelings of loneliness also had an increased likelihood of reporting insomnia. Fourthly, loneliness and COVID-19-related worry interacted with each other in predicting insomnia (\u00df = 0.30, SE = 0.13, p < .05). More specifically, the loneliness -insomnia relationship was strong e r a m o n g i n d i v i d u a l s w i t h h i g h e r l e v e l s o f COVID-19-related worry than those who reported lower levels of COVID-19-related worry (see Fig. 4 ).",

There are two possible explanations for these differences. First, there are cross-regional and cultural variations in loneliness and social isolation, as reported by D'Hombres et al. (2018), based on Joint Research Centre reports across European countries. Second, there are methodological issues, in that some studies used a single item to measure loneliness (e.g., Li & Wang, 2020) . Nevertheless, our finding demonstrates the robustness of loneliness as a predictor of poor mental health and behavioural problems, including anxiety, depressive symptoms, and insomnia. This is consistent with previous reports of a causal relationship between loneliness and physical and mental health problems (Beutel et al., 2017; Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2010; Lara et al., 2020; Leigh-Hunt et al., 2017; Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015; Lim et al., 2020; Solmi et al., 2020) . Our results also reinforce a growing body of research showing a significant association between loneliness during the pandemic and greater anxiety and depressive symptoms (Killgore et al., 2020a; Okruszek et al., 2020; Palgi et al., 2020; Tso & Park, 2020 ) and sleep problems (Grossman et al., 2021; Kokou-Kpolou et al., 2020a) . Furthermore, although a number of studies (Bu et al., 2020b; Buecker et al., 2020; Groarke et al., 2020; Hawkley et al., 2020; Solmi et al., 2020; Wickens et al., 2021) have found that high levels of loneliness during the ongoing pandemic vary according to sex, age, marital status, place of residence, and parenthood, we did not find that these variations predicted the severity of mental health and behavioural symptoms. Nevertheless, our findings showed that employment and working arrangements had a moderating effect on the relationship between loneliness and anxiety. Lonely feelings among individuals who had lost their job because of the pandemic were predictive of a severe risk of anxiety. In addition, individuals working from home who felt lonely tended to report more sleep problems. These results reflect the socioeconomic consequences of the pandemic on psychosocial wellbeing. The COVID-19 crisis has affected many business sectors, and tens of millions of individuals have lost or at risk to lose their jobs across the world. These socioeconomic consequences are found to translate in different forms of psychological distress including intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety, and social identity disturbance (Godinic et al., 2019) .",

A large number of studies on COVID-19 have shown, albeit separately, that people with preexisting health problems report greater prevalence of loneliness (Bu et al., 2020b; Groarke et al., 2020) , and experience poor mental health and behavioural problems (for reviews, see Wang et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2020) . Our findings reinforce these data and shed light on how the interaction between loneliness and preexisting physical or mental conditions exacerbates the risk of insomnia. It is somewhat surprising that this interaction was not associated with a higher likelihood of current anxiety and depressive symptoms. This may partially be explained by the shared mechanisms between previous medical and psychological conditions and current mental health status exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis.",

            "text": "Regarding the practical implications of the present study, our findings support the urgent need to pay attention to individuals with pre-existing health conditions The pandemic crisis with its consequent increase in fear, anxiety, etc., may have exacerbated their vulnerabilities and put them in heightened fragility (Megalakaki et al., 2021) . More so, the overemphasis on the pandemic may have translated into less attention to other diseases thereby leaving this categories of persons with less access to health care. A particular attention should be also paid to those who have lost their job because of the pandemic. These individuals have a greater risk of becoming disconnected from the professional and social networks that previously protected them. They are vulnerable to concerns and negative repetitive thoughts about their future prospects, which may increase their anxiety. Even though governments in many Western countries have implemented programmes to assist those who have lost their job because of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, together with other socioeconomically disadvantaged people, these may prove inadequate over the long term, in terms of meeting their basic psychosocial needs (e.g., self-utility, self-accomplishment) (C\u00e9nat et al., 2020) . Hence, these programmes should be accompanied by targeted mental health interventions. Attention should also be also paid to those who work from home, as abrupt transitions in work organization can lead to family and personal upheavals, which can affect sleep habits and homeostasis. Furthermore, our results on the dual moderating and mediating effects of COVID-19-related worry indicate that interventions aimed at slowing down perseverative cognition linked to the COVID-19 crisis and reducing the negative valence of its content would help people feeling lonely to improve their mental health and wellbeing. Loneliness is a modifiable factor, such that combined interventions targeting both loneliness and worry could lead to positive health outcomes for at-risk individuals as the pandemic continues to make itself felt.",

However, there were some limitations to the present study's findings regarding the extent to which they can be generalized. First, the self-reported nature of the study may have some peculiar responder biases which were not controlled for. Second, the cross-sectional nature of the data, coupled with the nonprobability sampling strategy we used, prevented us from establishing causal relationships between variables. A third limitation is related to the use of a single item to assess COVID-19-related worry. This may have promoted under-reporting of feelings of loneliness, which may disproportionately affect certain groups.",

            "text": "In sum, the present findings indicate that loneliness was a major mental health concern during the first COVID-19 lockdown in France. It was associated with three mental health and behavioural outcomes, namely anxiety, depressive symptoms, and insomnia. These health consequences of loneliness varied across sociodemographic groups. Employment and working arrangements, living conditions, preexisting medical or psychological problems, and COVID-19 related worry were found to moderate relationships between loneliness and the three mental health and behavioural outcomes. Both moderating and mediating effects were observed for COVID-19-related worry. This robust evidence-based knowledge could inform treatment recommendations for tackling prolonged self-isolation and loneliness during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for specific vulnerable groups. Future investigations could be extended to other vulnerable groups such as individuals who lost their loved ones during the pandemic and may be of particular concern for increased feelings of loneliness (Kokou-Kpolou et al., 2020b) . We encourage future research, if possible with longitudinal design, to use multiple-item scales in order to assess the multidimensional facets of loneliness (Anyan et al., 2020) . Given that our mediation models suggested partial mediation, future research could build on the current study's findings by investigating other cognitive vulnerability mechanisms that may account for stronger relationships between feelings of loneliness and mental health and behavioural outcomes. Furthermore, for more in-depth understanding of these mechanisms, quantitative methods may be complemented with qualitative methods such as online photovoice which is a contextually appropriate method to exploring biopsychosocial well-being and concerns in the context of disasters (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) (Tanhan, 2020; Tanhan & Strack, 2020) .
