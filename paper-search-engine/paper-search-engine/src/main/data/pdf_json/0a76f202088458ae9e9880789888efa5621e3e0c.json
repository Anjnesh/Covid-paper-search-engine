The objective of the present study was to compare the characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in different pandemic waves in terms of severity and mortality. We performed an observational retrospective cohort study of 5,220 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection from February to September 2020 in Aragon, Spain. We compared ICU admissions and 30-day mortality, clinical characteristics, and risk factors of the first and second waves of COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was also analyzed in 236 samples. Patients in the first wave (n = 2,547) were older (median age 74 years [IQR 60-86] vs. 70 years [53-85]; p < 0.001) and had worse clinical and analytical parameters related to severe COVID-19 than patients in the second wave (n = 2,673). The probability of ICU admission at 30 days was 16% and 10% (p < 0.001) and the cumulative 30-day mortality rates 38% and 32% in the first and second wave, respectively (p = 0.007). Survival differences were observed among patients aged 60 to 80 years. We also found some variability among death risk factors and the viral genome between waves. Therefore, the two analyzed COVID-19 pandemic waves were different in terms of disease severity and mortality.",

Compared to the first wave, patients in the second wave were younger and more frequently took antidiabetic drugs. In addition, the frequency of cognitive impairment was lower in the second wave. It is likely that patients with these features were also infected in the first wave but the number was obscured by the larger number of older and seriously ill patients. Older and seriously ill patients were less numerous in the second wave than in the first wave. However, although patients who required hospitalization and ICU care were younger in the second wave than in the first wave, the median age of death was higher in the second wave. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The most relevant finding in our study was that the overall 30-day mortality of hospitalized patients declined during the second wave. This significant decline in mortality affected essentially all patients aged 60 to 80 years old. A potential cause for this finding was that hospitalized patients had less severe parameters overall in the second wave than in the first wave. These parameters included vital signs and the clinical inflammation markers that serve as prognostic factors for severity [21] [22] [23] . Another explanation for the difference in mortality between waves could be improvements in the clinical management of patients. Although no antiviral drugs have clearly increased survival rates in patients with COVID-19, other advances in the management of patients with more severe infections have been associated with improved outcomes [24] [25] [26] . In addition, unlike the rapid increase observed in the first wave, during the second wave, the number of cases increased gradually. Therefore, although the health system had been overloaded, health resource use increased gradually, which prevented a system collapse. As such, this situation may be associated with better outcomes.",

We analyzed viral genomes from the first and second waves and found that the spike 614G mutation, which was abundant only at the end of the first wave, was present in all genomes isolated in the second wave. These findings have been described throughout the country 27 . Initially, this mutation was associated with greater disease severity 28 . However, a recent study indicated that, although the G614 variant is related to greater infectivity and higher viral loads, there is no evidence that it is associated with disease severity 29 .",

This situation prevented an overall comparison between pandemic waves. Due to these limitations, we focused the comparison on patients admitted to the hospital. In this environment, there has never been a shortage of diagnostic tests. Other limitations of this study were primarily due to its retrospective nature and the data source (i.e., electronic medical records). Furthermore, this study included data from the entire region, and different hospitals may have employed different management criteria and different resource allocations. However, some of these limitations are compensated for by the high number of patients included.",
