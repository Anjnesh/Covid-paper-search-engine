Currently, there are numerous public health challenges in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in the South Asian region, including Bangladesh. Learning from the first wave of infection of the COVID-19 that was an outbreak in China, there will be a slowdown of economic development with damaged supply chains that impact the public health systems in Bangladesh. Studies have identified that the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) [4] . It can trigger respiratory tract infection affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs). Fever, dry cough, and tiredness are the most common symptoms of COVID-19. Other symptoms included aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell, etc (https://www.webmd.com/lung/features/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19). In addition to respiratory symptoms, neurological manifestations [5] , Prognosis of liver and gastrointestinal involvement [6] , Clinical consequences of cardiovascular involvement in elderly patients [7] , [8] , musculoskeletal [9] , and other systematic presentations have also been reported [10] .",

The disease is being cured through symptomatic treatment including oxygen therapy and by the immune system.

It is important to record essential information and monitor the patients for proper management.

Though our finding showed no significant difference between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups (p>0.05), it was similar to the previous study of Hasan et al. [23] . Male domination in COVID-19 instances could be due to gender disparities in testing patients, women's shyness, and a more active male population than the female population in our country, particularly in terms of jobs outside the home.

Ali et al. reported recently that the prevalence of COVID-19 infected patients is clearly higher in urban areas (52.7%) than in rural areas (47.3%) [1] . We found that asymptomatic cases were reasonably higher in the house where more than 4 people lived together. However, total symptomatic cases (62%) outstripped asymptomatic cases (19%) by approximately threefold in our investigation. At least one comorbid was found in both the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups. Among them, diabetes, hypertension, and bronchial asthma were the most common in both groups. Previously, one study from Iran showed that diabetes (16.3%) and cardiovascular disorder (21%) were the most frequent comorbidities among the COVID-19 sufferer. At the same time, research from our country reported that hypertension (19.2%) and bronchial asthma (17.6%) were the two most common co-morbidities [28] . Cardiovascular complication, which includes myocarditis, acute cardiac injury, myocardial injury, arrhythmia, stroke, heart failure, cardiac shock, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, arterial and venous thrombotic events, and coagulopathy, is another common comorbidity [35] .",

From March 1 to April 15, 2021, a total of 1326 samples were collected. Samples were only obtained from non-critical COVID-19 patients as critically ill patients required emergency intensive care medications.

Besides, our investigation found a relatively higher proportion (36.18%) of altered smell and test symptoms, and it could be the second-wave effects of COVID-19.Earlier research from Hung et al. reported that 32% of COVID-19 patients needed Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, while Mondal et al. reported only 2.2%[28,50]. In our study, however, 8.7% of COVID-19 patients needed that ICU.
